==Davis County Courthouse==
The Davis County Courthouse was designed by [[Thomas J. Tolan|Thomas J. Tolan &amp; Son, Architects]], of Fort Wayne Indiana and is situated on the Bloomfield townsquare. In November 1876, the center of the square was cleared of trees and the following June, Larkworthy &amp; Menke, of Quincy, Illinois, was awarded the contract to supply stone. The bell was made by the Meneely &amp; Kimberly Bell Company of Troy, New York. The clock was made by the Seth Thomas Company and still resides within the clock tower.  The building was completed in 1879. A chain surrounding the courthouse was added in 1879 and an iron fence, by the Cleveland Wrought Iron Fence Company, was added in 1881.

On August 27, 1924, [[Henry D. Roland|Henry &quot;Dare-Devil&quot; Roland]], &quot;The Human Fly,&quot; attempted to climb the northwest corner of the courthouse. He fell to the ground from about 25 feet, breaking his hip. He was hospitalized in Bloomfield for six weeks, before returning back east with his wife and daughter. On June 28, 1932, Roland made a return trip to Bloomfield to remove the blot from his record of successful climbs. This time, in just eleven minutes, he was sitting perched astride the statue of Blind Justice. Roland died October 7, 1937, as a result of a trapeze fall at Ottway, Tennessee.

The Davis County Court House was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on May 3, 1974. The courthouse was photographed by [[Bob Thall]] as part of the Bicentennial project commissioned by Joseph E. Seagram &amp; Sons, Inc. to document more than 1,100 American courthouses. One of the results of this project was the 1978 book ''Court House,'' edited by Richard Pare. Thall's photo was part of the project's traveling exhibition and also appeared in ''[[The New York Times Book Review]],'' ''[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]]'' and ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazines.

The Bloomfield Square Historic District, which surrounds the courthouse, was added to the National Register's listings on November 7, 1976.

The Davis County Courthouse Preservation Fund was incorporated in November 2005.
