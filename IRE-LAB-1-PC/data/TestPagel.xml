==Davis County Courthouse==
The Davis County Courthouse was designed by [[Thomas J. Tolan|Thomas J. Tolan &amp; Son, Architects]], of Fort Wayne Indiana and is situated on the Bloomfield townsquare. In November 1876, the center of the square was cleared of trees and the following June, Larkworthy &amp; Menke, of Quincy, Illinois, was awarded the contract to supply stone. The bell was made by the Meneely &amp; Kimberly Bell Company of Troy, New York. The clock was made by the Seth Thomas Company and still resides within the clock tower.  The building was completed in 1879. A chain surrounding the courthouse was added in 1879 and an iron fence, by the Cleveland Wrought Iron Fence Company, was added in 1881.

On August 27, 1924, [[Henry D. Roland|Henry &quot;Dare-Devil&quot; Roland]], &quot;The Human Fly,&quot; attempted to climb the northwest corner of the courthouse. He fell to the ground from about 25 feet, breaking his hip. He was hospitalized in Bloomfield for six weeks, before returning back east with his wife and daughter. On June 28, 1932, Roland made a return trip to Bloomfield to remove the blot from his record of successful climbs. This time, in just eleven minutes, he was sitting perched astride the statue of Blind Justice. Roland died October 7, 1937, as a result of a trapeze fall at Ottway, Tennessee.

The Davis County Court House was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on May 3, 1974. The courthouse was photographed by [[Bob Thall]] as part of the Bicentennial project commissioned by Joseph E. Seagram &amp; Sons, Inc. to document more than 1,100 American courthouses. One of the results of this project was the 1978 book ''Court House,'' edited by Richard Pare. Thall's photo was part of the project's traveling exhibition and also appeared in ''[[The New York Times Book Review]],'' ''[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]]'' and ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazines.

The Bloomfield Square Historic District, which surrounds the courthouse, was added to the National Register's listings on November 7, 1976.

The Davis County Courthouse Preservation Fund was incorporated in November 2005.

'''Garden Grove''' is a city in [[Decatur County, Iowa|Decatur County]], [[Iowa]], [[United States]]. The population was 250 at the 2000 census. 

==History==
On April 24, 1846,&lt;ref&gt;Leland H. Gentry, &quot;The Mormon Way Stations: Garden Grove and Mt. Pisgah,&quot; ''BYU Studies'', 24:4 (Fall 1981), 448.&lt;/ref&gt; emigrants affiliated with [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] under the direction of [[Brigham Young]] established a way station halfway into their trek across Iowa. This semi-permanent settlement was named Garden Grove because the entire grove was covered with wild onions as far as the eye could see.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson Wheeler Whipple, &quot;Diaries, 1863-1887,&quot; p. 20, MSS SC 38, Harold B. Lee Library Special Collections, Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah.&lt;/ref&gt; Within three weeks of their arrival, the pioneers enclosed and planted {{convert|715|acre|km2}}.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Buchholz Kimball, ''Heber C. Kimball: Mormon Patriarch and Pioneer'' (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1981), 135.&lt;/ref&gt; They founded the village to assist those who did not have sufficient means to continue their journey, as well as to support and supply future companies of pioneers.&lt;ref&gt;Gentry, &quot;The Mormon Way Stations,&quot; 449.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Brigham Young and the main company left Garden Grove on May 12, 1846,&lt;ref&gt;William G. Hartley, &quot;Mormons and Early Iowa History (1838 to 1858): Eight Distinct Connections,&quot; ''The Annals of Iowa'' 59:3 (Summer 2000), 236.&lt;/ref&gt; the poorest and least prepared were left behind. After the Saints arrived in [[Winter Quarters (North Omaha, Nebraska)|Winter Quarters]], [[James Allen (Army engineer)|Captain James Allen]] brought orders from [[James K. Polk|President James Polk]] to enlist a battalion of Mormons for the War with Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Richard E. Bennett, ''Mormons at the Missouri: Winter Quarters, 1846-1852'' (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1987), 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Brigham Young and other leaders rode back as far as [[Mount Pisgah (Iowa)|Mt. Pisgah]] to encourage the men to enlist, and a letter was sent to the Saints in Garden Grove.&lt;ref&gt;B. H. Roberts, ''The Mormon Battalion: Its History and Achievements'' (Provo, Utah: Maasai, 2001), 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Only one man from the Garden Grove settlement, Edward Bunker, enlisted and served in the [[Mormon Battalion]].&lt;ref&gt;Edward Bunker, ''Autobiography of Edward Bunker'' (Provo: Brigham Young University, 1938), 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall of 1846, when the last of the Mormons were driven out of [[Nauvoo, Illinois]], the exiles camped on the west shore of the Mississippi River. Two rescue parties were sent from Winter Quarters and Council Bluffs,&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, ''Mormons at the Missouri'', 84.&lt;/ref&gt; and an additional group was requested from Garden Grove. Luman Shurtliff lead the third rescue party and brought the poorest of the exiles to the settlement at Garden Grove.&lt;ref&gt;Luman Andros Shurtliff, &quot;Journal of Luman Andros Shurtliff,&quot; pp. 64-66, 289.3701S562j, Stewart Library, Weber State University, Ogden, Utah.&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the winter of 1846/47, about 600 Latter-day Saints resided in Garden Grove.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, ''Mormons at the Missouri'', 90.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1852, the Mormon settlers had moved on to [[Utah]], selling the property and improvements to other American frontiersmen. Garden Grove is a site on the [[Mormon Trail|Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail]]. A marker just west of the city, overlooking a wooded ravine, marks the site of the former Mormon Cemetery.

'''Lamoni''' is a city in [[Decatur County, Iowa|Decatur County]], [[Iowa]], [[United States]]. The population was 2,444 at the 2000 census.  Lamoni is the home of [[Graceland University]], affiliated with the [[Community of Christ]].

The city is a significant historic area for the [[Community of Christ]] (Formerly known as the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints)which operates a historic site in the Lamoni, the Liberty Hall museum.  In 1870 a stewardship association of church members, known as the Order of Enoch, purchased over three thousand acres (12&amp;nbsp;km²) of land in southern Iowa as a place for gathering.

==City==
{{Refimprove|section|date=June 2009}}

The city was named after [[Lamoni]], a [[pacifism|pacifist]] king mentioned in the [[Book of Mormon]]. Church headquarters relocated to the emerging community in 1881 and [[Joseph Smith III]] made Liberty Hall his home. Four church presidents of the Community of Christ (then called the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints) lived in Liberty Hall. The church was headquartered in Lamoni, Iowa, and Liberty Hall was a center of social and religious life for the community.  During the next 60 years, Liberty Hall served as a home for the aged, a farmhouse, CCC Headquarters, and a private residence. Now restored to its 1900-1905 Victorian style, Liberty Hall reflects the culture of the large, middle class Smith family living in a small, mid-western town as well as the heritage of Community of Christ. Tours are available March through December.

Lamoni was named to the list of &quot;Best 100 cities for Young People&quot; in the nation by [[Americas Promise]] [http://www.americaspromise.org/100Best/winning_communities.cfm]
{{Blockquote|&quot;Lamoni received the 100 Best honor, in part, because of their collaborative programs on behalf of children and youth. The city is proud of its 'small town, rural work ethic' and works to ensure that young people learn responsibility, teamwork, and leadership skills in the community. One example of innovative thinking in regard to young people in Lamoni is the Across Ages mentoring program that matches at-risk middle school youth with senior adults in the community.&quot; [http://www.americaspromise.org/100Best/summaries/Iowa.pdf]}}

Among the significant structures in Lamoni are the Roy A. [[Cheville Chapel]], Closson Physical Education Center, Shaw Center for the Performing Arts, Frederick Madison Smith Library, and the Higdon Administration Building, all on the Graceland University Campus.

Recently, the Lamoni area has also become home to a sizable Amish community.

'''Burlington''' is a city in and the [[county seat]] of [[Des Moines County, Iowa|Des Moines County]], [[Iowa]], [[United States]].{{GR|6}}  The population was 26,839 the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]].  Burlington is the center of a [[Burlington micropolitan area|micropolitan area]] including [[West Burlington, Iowa]] and [[Middletown, Iowa]] and [[Gulf Port, Illinois]].  Burlington is the home of [[Snake Alley]], the crookedest alley in the world, and has been called the [[Backhoe]] Capital of the World.

==History==
[[File:Burlington IA Barber 1865p525 cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Burlington in 1865.]]
Prior to American settlement, the area was neutral territory for the [[Sac (tribe)|Sac]] and [[Fox (tribe)|Fox]] Indians, who called it &quot;Shoquoquon&quot; (Shok-ko-kon), meaning Flint Hills.&lt;ref&gt;http://spanky.thehawkeye.com/hawkeye/about.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1803, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Thomas Jefferson]] organized two parties of explorers to map the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. [[Lewis and Clark]] followed the [[Missouri River]], while [[Zebulon Pike|Lt. Zebulon Pike]] followed the [[Mississippi River]]. In 1805, Pike landed at the bluffs below Burlington and raised the [[Flag of the United States|United States Flag]] for the first time on Iowa soil and recommended the construction of a fort. The recommendation went unheeded.

The [[American Fur Company]] established a post in the area in 1829, but actual settlement began in 1833, shortly after the [[Black Hawk Purchase]] when Samuel (who also went by Simpson) White and David Tothero crossed the [[Mississippi River]] from Big Island. According to an account A.T. Andreas wrote in 1875, White erected a cabin in the area later platted to be Front Street between Court and High streets. Tothero went farther inland. Andreas called White and Doolittle the Romulus and Remus of their settlement, referring to the ancient heroes who founded [[Rome]] — another city surrounded by hills.

A few weeks later, William R. Ross crossed the Mississippi and established a general store. In November and December, he surveyed the settlement for White and Doolittle, and the following spring they allowed the purchaser of the first lot, John Gray, to rechristen the town. For $50, Gray named it after his hometown in [[Burlington, Vermont]]

In 1837, Burlington became the second territorial capital of the [[Wisconsin Territory]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.onmilwaukee.com/visitors/articles/beyondbelmont.html&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Iowa Territory]] was organized in the following year, Burlington became its first territorial capital.&lt;ref&gt;http://iagenweb.org/history/soi/soi31.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The government used &quot;Old Zion,&quot; the first Methodist Church in Iowa (located near what is now Third and Washington streets), to conduct business of the day. Although this building no longer exists, a [[historical marker]] may be found at its site.

On May 22, 1849, Maj. William Williams visited Burlington and provided a brief description in his journal:&lt;ref name=&quot;williams1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williams|first=William|year=1920|title=Major William Williams' Journal of a trip to Iowa in 1849|journal=Annals of Iowa|volume=12|issue=4|pages=246–247, with minor spelling and punctuation changes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This town [was] originally called Flint Hill- the Indian name was Shoquokon, Flint or Rock Hill.  [It is] beautifully elevated, situated on the west side of the Mississippi River, a place of very considerable business. The town is very well built. Houses are good, generally taste[ful], brick dwellings. A great many handsome residences on the more elevated parts of the bluff. The number of inhabitants between 3,000 and 3,500. ... Was the first seat of government after the formation of the Territory of Iowa. The view of the city is extremely picturesque from the river. The main part of the city is situated like an amphitheater formed by the surrounding hills, beautiful buildings and private residences on the eminences around. From the location of Burlington it must always be a place of considerable trade. The city is well built [in the] modern style, a very intelligent population... The river here is over 3/4 of mile wide and steam ferry boats constantly plying between this and the Illinois shore.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Iowa's nickname &quot;[[Hawkeye state|The Hawkeye State]]&quot; has its roots in Burlington. At Judge David Rorer's suggestion, publisher James G. Edwards changed ''The Iowa Patriot'' newspaper's name to ''The Hawk-Eye and Iowa Patriot'' in tribute to his friend [[Black Hawk (chief)|Black Hawk]]. Rorer is said to have found the name in ''[[The Last of the Mohicans]]''  while Edwards proposed the nickname to &quot;...rescue from oblivian [sic] a momento [sic], at least of the name of the old chief.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.netstate.com/states/intro/ia_intro.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Burlington was a bustling river [[port]] in the [[steamboat]] era and home to the [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad]]. The CB&amp;Q (1848–1970) merged into the [[Burlington Northern Railroad]] (BN, 1970–1996), which in turn merged into the [[BNSF Railway]] (BNSF, 1997–present). Even today, one of the BNSF's main east-west lines crosses the Mississippi at Burlington.

Perhaps the most noted feature of the city skyline, are the number of church steeples that soar into the sky, the highest of which belongs to [[Saints John and Paul Catholic Church (Burlington, Iowa)|St. John's Church]] (which contains a parish church, rectory, and a convent, situated on an entire block of land bordered by Division, and Market Streets to the north, and south, and South 8th, and South 7th Streets to the east, and west), which sits high on a hill overlooking downtown Burlington, the steeple stands over 100 foot above the peaked roof of the church, and has often been used by photographers to take panoramic vistas of the area. The only other structure that stands taller than the spire of St. John's, is the central pier of the [[Great River Bridge]], which soars over 370 feet above the [[Mississippi River]].

On July 8, 2010, Google accepted the first 3D building model for Burlington, Iowa.  The building is located at 1200 North Seventh Street.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZGWqX8SQQk&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has an area of 14.8 sq&amp;nbsp;mi (38.4&amp;nbsp;km²). 14.1 sq&amp;nbsp;mi (36.4&amp;nbsp;km²) of it is land and 0.8 sq&amp;nbsp;mi (2.0&amp;nbsp;km²) of it (5.26%) is water.

Burlington is served by the Burlington Community School District, which has five [[elementary school]]s, two [[middle school]]s (with a third completed, and ready to receive students, and a fourth under construction), one [[high school]] and one [[Alternative school|alternative high school]] Private education is also available for kindergarten through 12th grade at Notre Dame Catholic School, and Great River Christian School.

The Burlington School District has five elementary schools: North Hill, Sunnyside, Grimes, Corse and Black Hawk. All are new buildings or have been recently completely rehabilitated, the newest, North Hill Elementary, received its first students in 2009, there are no elementary school buildings within the school district that are over 40 years old. The district has two middle schools: James Madison and Oak Street. Beginning with the 2010-11 school year, Oak Street students will begin attending Aldo Leopold Middle School (named in honor of ecologist, and environmentalist, [[Aldo Leopold]], a former resident of Burlington, and author of &quot;''[[A Sand County Almanac]]''&quot;), the new school building, near the corner of Sunnyside Avenue, and Roosevelt Avenue, is a state-of-the-art three story building, intended to replace the aging Oak Street Building (the Oak Street building was completed around 1907), a third middle school building is currently under construction at the corner of Lawrence Street, and Mason Road. A tentative name of Burlington Southwest Middle School has been given to the building, and construction so far has not progressed past the outer shell of the building, this building is intended to replace the James Madison building, which has only been in the system since the mid 1960's. Burlington Community High School was constructed in 1968, and occupied the following year, with the first graduating class in June, 1970. Prior to that, the high school students were educated at a building located near the downtown business district; the building is still standing, but it remains unoccupied. Notre Dame High School and Elementary schools occupy a building near the Burlington high school. Great River Christian Schools occupies the old Prospect Hill Elementary School building (now closed),426 Harrison St. A third middle school building once existed on the edge of Perkins Park, named Horace Mann, that building was gutted by fire in 2005, and later razed. The school district offices are located near the corner of West Avenue, and White Street, in a large mansion once owned by Railroad tycoon Charles Elliot Perkins, and is nicknamed &quot;''The White House'',&quot; due to the whitewashed facade. The original High School building (which now serves as the School District Maintenance shops) is noted as being the first high school built west of the Mississippi River.

Burlington is also served by [[Southeastern Community College (Iowa)|Southeastern Community College]].

In 1975, author Philip Jordan published his book, &quot;Catfish Bend.&quot; In its epilogue, he wrote: &quot;Burlington today is both the same and different than it was when first settled. It is ugly and it is beautiful. It is progressive and retrogressive. It is both conservative and liberal.&quot; He also noted, &quot;Its bluffs still overlook a magnificent sweep of river dotted with islands which pioneers first noted.&quot;

== History ==
The territory in which Mediapolis is located is in the fourth of the magnificent states carved from the vast territory acquired from France in 1803 known as the Louisiana Purchase. In 1812 the Territory of Louisiana was reorganized and named the Territory of Missouri. In 1821, the State of Missouri was organized in its present form and the remaining portion was left for a time without any organized form of government. This was a part of the Territory of Michigan in 1834. Then in 1836, the Territory of Wisconsin was organized including what is now the States of Wisconsin, Minnesota and Iowa. In 1838, the territory was organized embracing that part of Wisconsin Territory lying west of the Mississippi River, north of the State of Missouri, (Iowa Territory). On the 28th day of December 1846, Iowa was admitted in its present from as the 29th State of the Union.

It was a vast wilderness inhabited with the exception of a few military posts, exclusively by Indians. The Sac and Fox tribes lived here at one time, all up and down the Mississippi River, Under Chiefs Black Hawk and Keokuk. Buffaloes and other wild animals abounded in every part of the state. It was destitute of woods, except near streams, where the most valuable lands were and settlers found good land for farming. The territory in which Mediapolis is located was ceded to the government by the Indians in 1832 and was known as the Black Hawk Purchase. These lands were opened for settlement on June 1, 1833. Nearly all the Indians had moved out of the area by 1840. Settlers moving westward camped near the spring at Kossuth. The spring was also an overnight camping place for Indians.

In 1834, the first permanent settlement was made near what is now Mediapolis and was known as Columbus. The early settlers came from Ohio, Pennsylvania and some from Kentucky by wagon train and riverboat, down the Ohio and up the Mississippi. A store was started in Columbus, but was later moved to Kossuth. In 1836 to 1850, the villages of Kossuth, Northfield, Linton, Dodgeville, Sperry, Kingston and Pleasant Grove, all were settled and became thriving villages with stores, churches, schools, post offices, blacksmith shops, hotels and even a doctor. Flour and woolen mills were the most important of the business firms.

One day in 1867, a group of citizens of Kossuth (a village one and one-half miles east of the present location of Mediapolis) happened to meet at the post office and they fell into a discussion concerning the prospects of a railroad from Burlington to Cedar Rapids. It was decided to call a public meeting to arouse interest in the proposal, and a few weeks later the meeting was held. Senator Gear and Judge Tracy of Burlington were there and persuaded the people that a “north and south” railroad was an absolute necessity and would prove to be a profitable investment. Therefore, in good faith, the people of Kossuth subscribed $20,000 toward this venture with the understanding that their village would have a station.

In 1869, however, the railroad engineers surveyed the roadbed one and one-half miles west of Kossuth where a station was later built. To ease the feelings of the community it was called “Kossuth Station”. A Mr. Hiram Leonard gave land for the railroad right-of-way on condition that it be laid as near Kossuth as possible. The railroad would run so near the west line that, to conform with the contract, the depot had to be placed on the east side of the track. When the depot was built in 1869 (before the rails were laid for the new railroad) railroad officials, although the road had not gone through, decided to use the name “Kossuth” on the new depot, the first. So the signs were fastened to each end of the building. Mr. Bullis, depot master from January 1, 1920 to March 1958, told this story to Mr. Ellis Harper, mail carrier and at one time postmaster. Boiling mad because the railroad had not come through Kossuth, a group of people from that community saddled their horses and rode to the new depot, where they took crowbars and removed the signs. It is reported that they buried the signs in a field, now the site of the swimming pool. After a few months, the railroad people put up new signs but they did not bear the name “Kossuth”. The depot was originally built on stilts as the surrounding area was low, but through the years the ground has been built up so that by 1962 when the original building was removed, the stilts could barely be seen. The upper half story of the depot contained four small rooms, which in the early days, housed the agent and his family.

In August 1869, the tracks were laid for a narrow gauge railroad which was later widened to standard gauge all in on day—125 miles on a Sunday, June 29, 1902. In the fall of 1869, the trains were running, and stopping at this station, but there was no town and no business here. That same fall, W.H. Cartwright, then doing business in Kossuth, saw what was inevitable and proposed that some of the people purchase the farmland lying immediately west of Kossuth, lay it out in lots, build and hotel, and make good sidewalks to the station. People of the Kossuth community ridiculed the idea that a town could be built any place other than the site of Old Kossuth. Cartwright, nevertheless, purchased the Isaac N. Ware farm and laid out that portion of the town that lies east of the track and north of Main Street. About the same time, W.W. King bought the farm lying west of Cartwright and laid out the town west of the track and north of Main Street. Andrew Hemphill, who owned the farm on the south side, laid out the southwest part of town, but could not plot any of his land east of the track. Cartwright moved his store to Mediapolis, and this was the beginning of business here.

Four years later the ‘station’ community was growing, sixty families were there, and the next logical step was to name this new village. The Rev. W. G. Kephart suggested the name “Mediapolis” meaning Middle City because it was exactly half way between the two county seats, Burlington and Wapello. Mr. Bullis said “a station agent by the name of John Wherle had nicknamed the town ‘Muddyoplis’ because, after heavy rains, there would be a lake just northeast of the station” and present location of Ben Mohler’s building.

The Independent School District of Mediapolis, was established in temporary quarters in 1873, and taught by Miss Maggie Bruce.

In 1875, the town was incorporated. Chas. P. King was elected mayor, and Joseph Goudy, recorder. On the 27th day of July 1875, the first council meeting was held and records show that J.W. McDonald, D. Kelly, Joab Harper, L. Talbott, and J.A. Bridges were the councilmen present. This was the first five years of the town. It had become the largest village in the county and the merchants were doing a heavy business.

Mediapolis is located in the southeastern part of Iowa, Des Moines County, on Highway 61, 13 miles north of Burlington. Highway 61 was first called the Telegraph road and was one of the first roads laid out in the State of Iowa and the first road built north from Burlington in 1836. Later it was called the Wapello Road, but it is perhaps most famous as &quot;''The Blues Highway'',&quot; due to its southward leg between St. Louis, and New Orleans.

==School==
On the north side of Mediapolis is the Mediapolis Community School, an elementary, middle, and high school serving Mediapolis and a large rural area around Mediapolis. The school's sports teams are the Bulldogs and Bullettes.

'''Milford''' is a city in [[Dickinson County, Iowa|Dickinson County]], [[Iowa]], [[United States]]. The population was 2,474 at the 2000 census.  The town includes many businesses related to its location in the [[Iowa Great Lakes]] region.

== History ==
===Old Town===
The [[Iowa Great Lakes]] Area was settled in the 1850s. It attracted many pioneers because of the rich black soil, water from the lakes,  and an abundance of wild game and fish. As the population increased at these times, a need for a good flouring mill was felt because the nearest mills were those in [[Mankato, Minnesota|Mankato]], [[Minnesota]] and [[Fort Dodge, Iowa|Fort Dodge]], [[Iowa]]. In 1861, there was an attempt to build one on Mill Creek, the outlet of the Great Lakes but the attempt was abandoned after the Indian raid of 1862 and the extremely low water level that year. In 1868 one was successfully built. A sawmill was built and put into operation in 1869. The mills began to attract many customers, and the small community began to grow. Old Town formed out of these customers and new businesses emerged. In 1870, the company that then operated the mill bought a section of land northwest of Old Town and laid out a plan for the town of Milford on land that the new railroad, which was built in 1882, was located on.&lt;ref&gt;Milford, Iowa Centennial Book pages 5-14&lt;/ref&gt;

===Milford===
On March 14, 1892, the first Town Council meeting was held. Some buildings were moved from Old Town to New Town (Milford) and many more businesses and residences were constructed. In 1921, the [[Flag of the United States|U.S. flag]] was flown at the new city hall for the first time and that year a vote approved to pave Okoboji Avenue (Main Street of Milford). The Milwaukee rail line which ran through Milford supplied the town with mail, groceries, clothing, lumber, coal, and machinery before automobiles could get to the Great Lakes. Two passenger trains made daily trips from [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]] to Spirit Lake, making 4 stops in Milford each day. Also another train from Spencer, a town south of Milford, made to runs every day. Until 1910, excursion trains came to the Lakes Area from Des Moines, [[Algona, Iowa|Algona]], and other towns on weekends and holidays. They usually carried 8-10 passenger coaches, and left on Sunday or at the end of the holidays. The last passenger train left Milford for Spencer in 1951. The last freight train left Milford for Spencer in 1976. By this time, the tracks were hardly ever used now that it was easier to get to the Lakes Area using the new highways. The tracks were dismantled in 1978&lt;ref&gt;Milford, Iowa Centennial Book pages 25-36&lt;/ref&gt; due to the fact that they were hardly ever used. The tourists that came every summer came by the new highways and stopped using the railroad for transportation. The Iowa Great Lakes is still a huge attraction that swells the summer population to about 100,000.

===Iowa Great Lakes===
The [[Iowa Great Lakes]] is a popular area for many people that swells the summer population in Dickinson County to about 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.okobojifoundation.org/visioning/docs/Arts-Culture.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
===Bike trail===
The Dickinson County Bike Trail was built in 1990 on the old railroad bed. It begins in Milford and takes its travelers to the east shore of Minnewashta and meets back up with Highway 71 in Arnolds Park before it reaches the old railroad bridge that it crosses, where there is a view of both West and East Lakes. It then goes through the town of Okoboji and ends in Spirit Lake.&lt;ref&gt;Milford, Iowa Centennial Book page 44&lt;/ref&gt;

===Horseshoe Bend Park===
Horseshoe Bend Park is a {{convert|180|acre|km2|sing=on}} park about 7 miles southwest of Milford. It is named after the bend in the Little Sioux River. The park is located on the north and south side of the bed. On the north side, there is a picnic shelter and the old slide that was once the second story fire escape for the Milford Elementary School. Down the hill in the river valley there are trails for walking and a walking bridge that leads to the south end of the park. On the south end, a lift is opened in the winter, where visitors may enjoy snow skiing, sledding, or snow tubing. There is also a shelter with a large circular fireplace and sitting area for visitors burdened by the harsh cold of Iowa winters.&lt;ref&gt;Milford, Iowa Centennial Book pages pages 44-45&lt;/ref&gt;

== Businesses ==
===Stylecraft===
After the Gable Furniture Company of Des Moines closed down, Robert C. Reed and James Tollefson bought the manufacturing operation in Milford. They soon began making upholstered chairs under the name Stlyecraft which opened in 1972. Early in the history of the company, Stlyecraft gained a reputation for the production of good quality products at very reasonable prices and employed about 150 people by 1978. By 1983, Stylecraft's employment grew to 300. By the spring of 1992, more than 800 people were  employed directly by Stylecraft,&lt;ref&gt;Milford, Iowa Centennial Book page 84&lt;/ref&gt; making it one of the major employers in a town of 2,474.  After recent buy-outs and outsourcing, Stylecraft has now become a subsidiary of Klausner Furniture.  These events have led to a dramatic reduction of employees creating far-reaching economic and community changes.

===Gravel===
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:035n2.jpg|frame|Gravel.]] --&gt;
'''&quot;Milford's Hidden Gold&quot;'''&lt;br /&gt;Since 1910, businesses have taken advantage of the huge amounts of gravel that is under and surrounds Milford, and was first mined by the Milwaukee Railroad. To the east, west, and south of town there are gravel pits either exhausted and abandoned-some used as junkyards or ones still used that change the face of the Earth almost overnight. Milford Sand &amp; Gravel is one company that mines and washes the gravel for industrial use.&lt;ref&gt;Milford, Iowa Centennial Bood page 39&lt;/ref&gt;

===Milford Elevator===
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:021n2.jpg|thumb|Milford Elevator.]] --&gt;
The Milford Elevator has served the Milford Community is a greatly needed accommodation for the farmers of the Milford Area. It was owned by Great Lakes Cooperative until April 3, 2008 when GLC merged with Great Plains Renewable Energy, Inc.

[[Image:AsburyPopulation.JPG|375px|thumb|right|Population history of Asbury, Iowa (1940-2005).]]
'''Asbury''' is a city in [[Dubuque County, Iowa|Dubuque County]], [[Iowa]], [[United States]], and a [[suburb]] of the city of [[Dubuque, Iowa|Dubuque]]. It is part of the Dubuque, Iowa [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. The population was 2,450 at the 2000 census, but is now estimated to be 3,754 (2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Asbury population estimate 2007 |accessdate = July 11, 2008 |url = http://data.iowadatacenter.org/datatables/PlacesAll/plestpopbyco20002007.xls}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asbury is the third-largest city in Dubuque County, but it will likely soon pass [[Dyersville, Iowa]] to become the second-largest. The city is largely a [[Commuter town|bedroom community]], made up of spacious, new [[Subdivision (land)|subdivisions]] whose residents work in Dubuque or [[Peosta, Iowa]].

Asbury has experienced a 53.3% increase in population from 2000 to 2007, making it the state's 10th-fastest growing city (with 1,000 people or more) during that period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = 2007 population estimates for Iowa municipalities |accessdate = July 11, 2008 |url = http://data.desmoinesregister.com/results/index.php?info=census_iamuni07&amp;BRSR=0&amp;displayStyle=2&amp;submit=&amp;Community=&amp;July0607DiffPerc=&amp;July0007DiffPerc=&amp;July2007Est=&amp;July2006Est=&amp;July2000Est=&amp;sort=July0007DiffPerc&amp;desc=desc&amp;update=Sort#tbl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Asbury was settled beginning in the 1830s, at first by [[Methodism|Methodists]]. The city is named after British-born Bishop [[Francis Asbury]], one of the first two [[bishop]]s of the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]] in the [[United States]]. The city was incorporated in 1933, following the passage of the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which ended [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]]. The city incorporated to gain the legal standing necessary to sell [[alcohol]], as [[liquor license]]s were still forbidden in [[Rural|rural areas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = History of Asbury |accessdate = January 2, 2007 |url = http://cityofasbury.com/about_us.html |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061009100135/http://www.cityofasbury.com/about_us.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = October 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For most of its history, Asbury was very small, much like hundreds of other towns in rural Iowa. In the 1960 census, Asbury still had only 71 residents. During this time, the City of Dubuque grew immensely, and the [[Urban sprawl|sprawl]] reached the Asbury area beginning in the 1960s. By 1970, Asbury had 410 residents and had grown fast enough to become the fastest growing city in the state of Iowa.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;

Asbury continues to grow at a rapid pace today, expanding over 50% since the year 2000, and currently (2007) counts 3,754 residents. This number is certain to increase, as an ever-growing number of new subdivisions are being built or planned for the area.

==Law and government==
Asbury has a [[Mayor-council government|mayor-council]] form of [[government]], employing a full-time [[City manager|city administrator]], and part-time [[city council]] ([[mayor]] and 5 [[at-large]] city council members). The city administrator is Beth Bonz, the current mayor is Jim Adams, and the council members are: Jaime Nedved, Andy Kindle, Kate Perrin, Bob Reisch, and Deb Roth. The city council meets at 7 P.M. on the second and fourth Tuesdays of every month at Asbury City Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Asbury city council members |accessdate = January 2, 2007 |url = http://cityofasbury.com/members.html |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061009095556/http://www.cityofasbury.com/members.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = October 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city council works on the advice of a number of citizen [[committees]], including the following: Building Code Commission, Park &amp; Recreation Board, Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, Zoning Board of Adjustment, and the Water Board. In addition, Asbury sends commissioners to the Eastern Iowa Housing Authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Asbury boards &amp; commissions |accessdate = January 2, 2007 |url = http://cityofasbury.com/boardsandcomm.html |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061009100351/http://www.cityofasbury.com/boardsandcomm.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = October 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asbury has 3 city departments: Public Safety ([[police]] &amp; [[Fire station|fire]]), [[Public Works]], and [[Parks]].

In the [[Iowa General Assembly]], Asbury is represented by Senator [[Tom Hancock]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[Epworth, Iowa|Epworth]]) in the [[Iowa Senate]], and Representative Steven Lukan ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[New Vienna, Iowa|New Vienna]]) in the [[Iowa House of Representatives]]. At the federal level, it is within [[Iowa's 1st congressional district]], represented by [[Bruce Braley]] (D-[[Waterloo, Iowa|Waterloo]]) in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]]. Asbury, and all of Iowa, are represented by U.S. Senators [[Chuck Grassley]] (R) and [[Tom Harkin]] (D).

There are no private schools currently operating in Asbury, but many [[parochial school]] students attend private schools in Dubuque, as they are open to anyone, regardless of location. Many of these students are enrolled in the [[Holy Family Catholic Schools|Holy Family Catholic School System]], and attend nearby [[Resurrection Catholic Church (Dubuque)|Resurrection Elementary School]], [[Mazzuchelli Middle School]], and [[Wahlert High School]]. There is also a private elementary school serving the Lutheran community in the area, the Dubuque Lutheran School ([[Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod|LCMS]] affiliated).

==Neighborhoods==
Asbury is a city of neighborhoods. Since the city is very young, and much of its growth has occurred only recently, its subdivisions are still clearly identifiable. Generally, eastern and southern parts of the city are older, while northern and western areas are of entirely new construction. Asbury's &quot;[[main street]]&quot; is Asbury Road, and most of the [[neighborhoods]] branch off of this artery. The city is growing at a phenomenal clip, adding 544 new [[single-family homes]] since 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Asbury single-family residential construction |accessdate = July 11, 2008 |url = http://www.city-data.com/city/Asbury-Iowa.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cassin and Chuck Hazel (Bay Partners) provided the initial $3 million funding and the company officially began operations on July 1, 1982. It shipped its first product in February 1983 to Convergent Technology and immediately received an additional $5.5 million in its second round of funding. The company also began negotiations with the EDB (Economic Development Board) of Singapore for favorable terms before committing to Singapore as its offshore manufacturing location. The DBS (Development Bank of Singapore) agreed to provide financing to help grow the company in Singapore. In 1983, the company established a liaison and procurement office in Tokyo, headed by Tatsuya Yamamoto.

Maxtor's product architecture used eight disks; 15 surfaces recorded data and the final surface was where the servo track information was located. The company developed its own spindle motor, which was fitted within the casting containing the disks. This was a major departure, the motor usually being mounted external to the disks. The first product was designed to provide 190&amp;nbsp;MB of storage, but delays in getting magnetic heads to the Maxtor design resulted in the company taking what was available and the first drives were shipped with a capacity of only 140&amp;nbsp;MB. The company received an additional round of financing of approximately $37 million in 1984 before going public in 1985, with Goldman Sachs as the prime underwriter.

=== MiniScribe acquisition ===

In 1990 Maxtor entered the mass market with its purchase of the assets (but not the liabilities) of bankrupt [[MiniScribe]] in [[Longmont, Colorado]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE7D7163EF930A35754C0A966958260 MiniScribe assets acquisition]&lt;/ref&gt;  The transition was a tough one, with the early products of this union (notably the 7120 3.5-inch 120&amp;nbsp;MB drive) having many quality and design problems. Later products managed to sell well despite the initial problems, and in 1996 the company completely redesigned its drive lines, introducing the [[Texas Instruments]] [[digital signal processor|DSP]]-based ''DiamondMax'' series.

=== Financial troubles ===
After nine years of development, the original XT-series of drives had achieved a capacity of 1&amp;nbsp;GB.  Maxtor sold the rights to the series to Sequel of Santa Clara, California, in the mid-1990s, thus exiting the server SCSI drive market.  Sequel, a spin-off of [[Unisys]], was not a disk drive manufacturer; rather, they specialized in refurbishing drives for the existing customer base.  Teetering on the brink of bankruptcy in 1992, Maxtor's exit from the high capacity 5.25-inch SCSI market temporarily left a product void in the industry.  Around this time, [[SCSI]] versions of the 7000 series drives were also discontinued and all engineering operations in San Jose were shut down in late 1993, leaving only the former MiniScribe design engineering staff.  After turnover in the executive staff, Maxtor decided it had made a mistake, and having moved its headquarters to nearby [[Milpitas, California|Milpitas]], gradually began rebuilding its [[Silicon Valley]] engineering staff.

=== Quantum hard drives acquisition ===
In 2000, Maxtor purchased [[Quantum Corp|Quantum's]] hard drive business.&lt;ref&gt;Quantum was headquartered at 500 McCarthy Blvd. in Milpitas at the time.  Maxtor eventually moved its headquarters to that address, prior to their acquisition by Seagate.&lt;/ref&gt;  The acquisition became effective on April 1, 2001. This move made them larger than their rivals (notably Seagate), and also returned them to the server-SCSI market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crn.com/it-channel/18811626 Article from CRN]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Maxtor onetouch.JPG|200px|thumb|A Maxtor OneTouch III Mini Edition drive]]

== As of 2006 ==
Maxtor, in recent years, like many other hard drive makers, had been expanding into the external hard disk market, with the ''Maxtor One-Touch II'' personal hard drive, which is marketed as convenient external storage for the home user.

Maxtor had initially made efforts to get into the 2.5-inch hard disk market ([[laptop|notebook computer]] format) but, in the beginning of 2005, new management made the surprising decision to discontinue development in this field. This was considered by many industry watchers{{Who|date=October 2007}} to be a particularly peculiar move, since the market for such hard drives (mainly notebook computers and [[mp3 player|MP3 players]]) was already experiencing rapid growth, with no signs of slowing down in the foreseeable future.

In a deal worth US$1.9 billion, Maxtor was acquired by its rival Seagate in 2006. It is now used as a Seagate brand.

A series of storage solutions continues to be sold under the Maxtor brand name.  The current Maxtor product line includes:
* Maxtor OneTouch 4
* Maxtor OneTouch 4 Plus
* Maxtor OneTouch 4 Mini
* Maxtor OneTouch 3 Turbo Edition

'''Paprika''' is a [[spice]] made from the grinding of dried fruits of ''[[Capsicum annuum]]'' (e.g., [[bell pepper]]s or [[chili pepper]]s). In many [[Europe]]an languages, the word ''paprika'' refers to bell peppers themselves.  The seasoning is used in many cuisines to add color and flavor to dishes. Paprika can range from mild to hot. Flavors also vary from country to country.

== Etymology ==
According to Hindu legend, paprika is said to have been named after a religious Indian figure named &quot;Rysh Paprike&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=Paprika is a Dried Fruit | url=http://demo.thethemefoundry.com/traction/2010/02/03/paprika-is-a-dried-fruit/
| publisher=The Theme Foundary | year=20 | accessdate=2010-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern times, the word paprika is said to be derived from the [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] ''paprika'', meaning [[Black pepper|pepper]] ([[Capsicum]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=GugWAQAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_v2_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=paprika&amp;f=false ''Treasury decisions under customs and other laws'', By United States. Dept. of the Treasury ]&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative claim is that 'paprika' is derived from the Latin 'piper' (pepper) through Slavic diminutive forms ('pepperke', 'pipeka'), and came into currency in 1775.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

== Usage ==
Paprika is used as an ingredient in a broad variety of dishes throughout the world.  Paprika is principally used to season and color rices, stews, and soups, such as [[goulash]], and in the preparation of [[sausage]]s as an ingredient that is mixed with meats and other spices.

Paprika was first produced in Spain, as that country was also responsible for the introduction of the [[bell pepper]] into Europe. In Spain, paprika is known as ''Pimentón'', and is available in numerous varieties; ''pimentón ahumado'', for example has a distinct smokey flavor and aroma, as it is dried by [[smoking (food)|smoking]], typically using [[oak]] wood. It is available in three versions, mild, moderately spicy and very spicy. Regular unsmoked paprika, known simply as ''Pimentón'', is also available in the same varieties. Pimentón is a key ingredient in several Spanish sausage products, such as [[chorizo]] or [[sobrasada]], as well as much [[Spanish cuisine|Spanish cooking]].  Outside of Spain ''pimentón ahumado'' is often referred to as simply &quot;smoked paprika&quot; and can be found in varying intensities from sweet and mild (dulce), medium hot (agridulce), or very hot and spicy (picante).

[[Hungary]] is a major source of paprika and is thus more commonly used. It is available in grades ranging as follows: 
Special quality (Különleges) the mildest, very sweet with a deep bright red color.
Delicate (Édes csemege) – color from light to dark red, a mild paprika with a rich flavor.
Exquisite Delicate (Csemegepaprika) – similar to Delicate, but more pungent.
Pungent Exquisite Delicate (Csípős Csemege, Pikáns) - an even more pungent version of Delicate.
Rose (Rózsa) – pale red in color with strong aroma and mild pungency.
Noble Sweet (Édesnemes) – the most commonly exported paprika; bright red and slightly pungent.
Half-Sweet (Félédes) – A blend of mild and pungent paprikas; medium pungency.
Strong (Erős) – light brown in color, the hottest paprika.

According to an old [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] saying, good paprika burns twice. Paprika contains strong spices, these may cause a burning sensation in the [[mucous membranes]] of the [[anus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Lawless | first = Harry | title = Sensory evaluation of food: principles and practices | publisher = Chapman &amp; Hall | date = 1998, 1999 | pages = 61 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=BTR7VEJPDWAC&amp;dq=Sensory+evaluation+of+food:+principles+and+practices.&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=iVi-6d7iO4&amp;sig=dCOq_gqxX-CPuZbVg_9ZA5YxQl4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=LW0QS93nJs7GlAfrkp2xAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CBoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=anus&amp;f=false | isbn = 0-8342-1752-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paprika can also be used with [[henna]] to bring a reddish tint to hair when coloring it. Paprika powder can be added to henna powder when prepared at home.

== Nutrition ==
Capsicum peppers used for paprika are unusually rich in [[vitamin C]], a fact discovered in 1932 by Hungary's 1937 Nobel prize-winner [[Albert Szent-Györgyi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=: Szeged, 1931-1947: Vitamin C, Muscles, and WWII: | url=http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/WG/Views/Exhibit/narrative/szeged.html | work=The Albert Szent-Gyorgyi Papers | publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine | date= | accessdate=2009-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the vitamin C content is retained in paprika, which contains more vitamin C than [[lemon juice]] by weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=Nutrition Facts Comparison Tool: Spices Paprika v. Lemon Juice Raw | url=http://www.healthaliciousness.com/nutritionfacts/nutrition-comparison.php?o=2028&amp;t=9152&amp;h=102&amp;s=100&amp;e=100&amp;r= | work=Healthaliciousness | year=2009 | accessdate=2009-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paprika is also high in other antioxidants,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ars.usda.gov/SP2UserFiles/Place/12354500/Data/ORAC/ORAC07.pdf &quot;Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) of Selected Foods – 2007&quot;], ''[[United States Department of Agriculture]]'', November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; containing about 10% of the level found in [[açaí]] berries.  Prevalence of nutrients, however, must be balanced against quantities ingested, which are generally negligible for spices.

{{Nihongo|'''Original video animation'''|オリジナル・ビデオ・アニメーション|''Orijinaru bideo animēshon''}}, abbreviated as {{Nihongo|'''OVA'''|オーブイエー / オーヴィーエー / オヴァ|ōbuiē, ōvīē or ova}} media (and sometimes as '''OAV''' by [[English language|English]]-speakers), are [[animation|animated]] films and series made specially for release in [[home video|home-video]] formats.  The term originated in relation to [[Japan]]ese animation ([[anime]]).{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}  Most producers of OVAs release them [[direct-to-video]], without prior showings on [[television|TV]] or in theatres; however, there may be very rare occasions where, for example, the first part of an OVA series is broadcast for promotional purposes. OVA titles were originally made available on [[Video Home System|VHS]], later becoming more popular on [[LaserDisc]] and eventually [[DVD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.g4tv.com/animeunleashed/features/50642/Anime_Glossary.html|title=Anime Glossary|last=Nakayama|first=Whitney|publisher=[[G4 (TV channel)|G4]]|date=2004-12-21|accessdate=2008-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in summer 2008 the term OAD (original animation DVD) began to refer to DVD releases published bundled with their source material manga.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/lexicon.php?id=35|title=Original Animation Video (OAV/OVA)|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=2009-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
Like anime made for television broadcast, OVAs sub-divide into episodes.  OVA media (tapes, [[laserdisc]]s, or DVDs) usually contain just one episode each.  Episode length varies from title to title: each episode may run from a few minutes to two hours or more.  An episode length of 30 minutes is quite common, but this is by no means the rule. In some cases, the length of episodes in a specific OVA may vary greatly (in ''[[The King of Braves GaoGaiGar FINAL|GaoGaiGar FINAL]]'', the first 7 episodes last around 30 minutes, while the last episode lasted 50 minutes; the OVA ''[[Key the Metal Idol]]'' consists of 15 separate episodes, ranging in length from 20 minutes to nearly two hours each; {{as of | 2009 | lc = on }} the OVA ''[[Hellsing]]'' had released 7 episodes, ranging from 42 minutes to 56 minutes (it has yet to finish releasing the remaining episodes.) An OVA series can run anywhere from an episode (essentially a direct-to-video movie) to dozens in length. Probably the longest OVA series ever made was ''[[Legend of the Galactic Heroes]]'', which spanned 110 main episodes and 52 [[gaiden]] episodes.

Many popular series first appear animated as an OVA, and later grow to become television series or movies. ''[[Tenchi Muyo!]]'', for example, began as an OVA but went on to spawn several TV series, three movies, and numerous other spin-offs. Producers make other OVA releases as sequels, side stories, music-video collections, or bonus episodes that continue existing television series or films, such as ''[[Love Hina Again]]'' and ''[[Wolf's Rain]]''.

OVA titles generally have a much higher budget per episode than in a television series; therefore the technical quality of animation can generally surpass that in television series; occasionally it even equals that of animated [[film|movies]].

OVA titles have a reputation for the detailed plots and character-development which can result from the greater creative freedom offered to writers and directors in comparison with other formats. This also allows for animated adaptations of manga to reflect their source material more faithfully. Since OVA [[episode]]s and series have no fixed conventional length, OVA directors can use however much time they like to tell the story. Time becomes available for significant background and character/plot development. This contrasts with television episodes (which must begin and conclude in 22 to 26 minutes) and with films (which rarely last more than two hours). In the same way, no pressure exists to produce &quot;filler content&quot; to extend a short plot into a full television series. The producers of OVA titles generally target a specific audience, rather than the more mass-market audience of films and television series, and may{{Or|date=January 2010}} feel less constrained by content-restrictions and censorship (such as for violence, nudity, or language) often placed on television series.

Much OVA-production aims at an audience of male anime enthusiasts. [[Bandai Visual]] stated in a 2004 news release (for their new OVAs aimed at women) that about 50% of the customers who had bought their anime DVDs in the past fell into the category of 25- to 40-year-old men, with only 13% of purchasers women, even with all ages included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
These statistics cover Bandai Visual anime DVDs in general, not just OVAs, but they show the general tendency at this point{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}. [[Nikkei Business Publications]] also stated in a news-release that mainly 25- to 40-year-old adults bought anime DVDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;
Few OVAs specifically target female audiences, but ''[[Earthian]]'' exemplifies the exceptions.

Usually one volume costs between 5800 to 9800 [[Japanese yen|yen]] {{as of | 2006 | lc = on}}, higher-priced than other anime DVDs, though some sell for less (''[[Patlabor|Mobile Police Patlabor]]'' OVAs (1988) sold at 4800 yen per volume).

Some OVAs based on television series (and especially those based on [[manga]]) may provide [[Closure (psychology)|closure]] to the plot – closure not present in the original series. The ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]'' OVAs, to name one series, exemplified numerous aspects of OVAs; they were based on chapters of the author [[Nobuhiro Watsuki]]'s manga that had not been adapted into the TV anime, had higher-quality animation, were much more violent, and were executed in a far more dark and realistic style than the TV episodes.

Dark realism featured in [[Masami Kurumada]]'s famous manga ''[[Saint Seiya]]''. The anime adapted two of the three [[story arc|arc]]s in Kurumada's manga - the [[project]] to adapt the third arc to the anime never started. As Kurumada had completed his manga in 1991, its third act was finally adapted to anime, releasing the episodes as OVAs, starting in 2003 and finishing in 2008, at last adapting Kurumada's manga completely to anime.

Most OVA titles run for 4 to 8 episodes. They tend to have a complex and continuous plot{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}, best enjoyed if all episodes are viewed in sequence.  This contrasts with television series, which generally have many short &quot;mini-stories&quot; that happen to be related somehow, rather than a unified plot.  Many OVA titles can be thought of as &quot;long films&quot; that just so happen to be released in parts. Release schedules vary, as some series may progress as slowly as 1-2 episodes per year.  Some OVA titles with a lengthy release-schedule ended up unfinished due to lack of fan support and sales.

Many one-episode OVAs exist as well. Typically, such an OVA provides a [[side-story]] to a popular TV series.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} At an early stage in the history of the OVA (1980s) many one-episode OVAs appeared. Hundreds of manga that were popular but not enough to gain TV series were granted one-shot (or otherwise extremely short) OVA episodes.

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2010}}
{{Original research|section|date=April 2010}}
OVAs originated during the late 1970s. As the [[video cassette recorder|VCR]] became a widespread fixture in Japanese homes, the Japanese anime industry grew to behemoth proportions. Demand for anime became massive, so much so that consumers would willingly go directly to video stores to buy new animation outright. While people in the [[United States]] used{{When|date=April 2010}} the phrase &quot;[[direct-to-video]]&quot; as a pejorative for works that could not make it onto television or movie screens, in Japan the demand was so great that direct-to-video became a necessity. Many popular and influential series such as ''[[Bubblegum Crisis]]'' (1987-1991) and ''[[Tenchi Muyo!]]'' (1992-2005) were released directly to video as OVAs.

The earliest known attempt to release an OVA involved [[Osamu Tezuka]]'s ''[[The Green Cat]]'' (part of the [[Lion Books (manga)|Lion Books]] series) in 1983, although it cannot count as the first OVA: we lack evidence that the [[VHS]] tape became available immediately, and the series remained incomplete. Therefore the first official OVA release to be billed as such was 1983's ''[[Dallos]]'', directed by [[Mamoru Oshii]] and released by [[Bandai]]. Other famous early OVAs, premièring shortly thereafter, were ''[[Iczer One|Fight!! Iczer One]]'' and the original ''[[Megazone 23]]''. Other companies were quick to pick up on the idea, and the mid-to-late 1980s saw the market flooded with OVAs. During this time, most OVA series were new, stand-alone titles.

As the Japanese economy worsened in the 1990s, the flood of new OVA titles diminished to a trickle.  Production of OVAs continued, but in smaller numbers. Many anime TV series ran an economical 13 episodes rather than the traditional 26-episodes per season. New titles were often designed{{By whom|date=November 2009}} to be released to TV if they approached these lengths. In addition, the rising popularity of cable and satellite TV networks (with their typically less strict censorship rules) allowed the public to see direct broadcasts of many new titles - previously that would have been impossible. Therefore many violent, risque, and [[fanservice]] series became regular TV series when previously those titles would have been OVAs. During this time period most OVA content was limited to that related to existing and established titles.

However, in 2000 and later, a new OVA trend began. Producers released many TV series without normal broadcasts of all of the episodes – but releasing some episodes on DVD-videos of the series.  Examples of this include the DVD-only [[Love Hina media information|25th episode]] of ''[[Love Hina]]'', while [[List of Oh My Goddess episodes|several episodes]] of the ''[[Oh My Goddess]]'' TV series are DVD-only. In addition, the final episode of [[Excel Saga]] was offered only as an OVA, mostly due to content issues that would have made TV broadcast impossible. In these cases the series as a whole cannot be called an OVA, though certain episodes are. This trend is becoming quite common, and furthermore, many recent OVA series pre-broadcast the episodes and release the DVD with unedited and better quality, revised animations – thus further blurring the boundary between TV and video anime.

'''''Stand and Deliver''''' is a [[1988 in film|1988]] [[Cinema of the United States|American]] [[drama film]]. The film is a dramatization based on a true story of a dedicated high school mathematics teacher [[Jaime Escalante]]. [[Edward James Olmos]] portrayed Escalante in the film and received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor for his role.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' film review; 17 February 1988&lt;/ref&gt; 

Jaime Escalante, the East Los Angeles mathematics teacher whose story inspired the movie Stand and Deliver, died from [[bladder cancer]] at his son's home on March 30, 2010. [http://www.thecancerblog.com/2010/04/01/jaime-escalante-dies-of-bladder-cancer/]

==Plot==
In the predominately Chicano area of [[East Los Angeles, California]], in 1982, in an environment that values a quick fix over education and learning, [[Jaime Escalante|Jaime A. Escalante]] ([[Edward James Olmos]]) is a new teacher at [[Garfield High School (Los Angeles County, California)|Garfield High School]] in [[Los Angeles County]], [[California]] determined to change the system and challenge the students to a higher level of achievement. Leaving a steady job for a position as a math teacher in a school where rebellion runs high and teachers are more focused on discipline than academics, Escalante is at first not well liked by students, receiving numerous taunts and threats. As the year progresses, he is able to win over the attention of the students by implementing innovative teaching techniques, using props and humor to illustrate abstract concepts of math and convey the necessity of math in everyday lives. He is able to transform even the most troublesome teens to dedicated students. While Escalante teaches math 1A, basic [[arithmetic]], he realizes that his students have far more potential so he decides to teach them [[calculus]]. To do so, he holds a summer course of what is implied in the movie as pre-calculus material, such as advanced [[algebra]], math analysis, and [[trigonometry]]. Calculus starts in the students' senior year.

Despite concerns and skepticism of other teachers, who feel that &quot;you can't teach [[logarithm]]s to illiterates&quot;, Escalante nonetheless develops a program in which his students can eventually take [[AP Calculus]] by their senior year, which will give them credit toward college. This intense math program requires that students take summer classes, including Saturdays from 7:00 AM to noon, taxing for even the most devoted among them. While other students spend their summers working or becoming teenage parents, Escalante's students learn complex theorems and formulas. The vast contrast between home life and school life, however, begins to show as these teens struggle to find the balance between what other adults and especially their parents expect of them and the goals and ambitions they hold for themselves. Several students must confront issues at home.  In a memorable scene, Escalante follows a crying girl as she leaves the classroom and runs through the school.  Reaching out to the girl, Escalante puts his arm around her shoulder, in a rare display of compassion.  With Escalante to help them, they soon find the courage to separate from society's expectations for failure and rise to the standard to which Escalante had set for them.

Taking the AP Calculus exam in the spring of their senior year, these students are relieved and overjoyed to be finished with a strenuous year. After receiving their scores, they are overwhelmed with emotion to find that they have all passed, a feat done by few in the state. Later that summer a shocking accusation is made: the [[Educational Testing Service]] calls into question the validity of their scores when it is discovered that similarities between errors is too high for pure chance. Outraged by the implications of cheating, Escalante feels that the racial and economic status of the students has caused the ETS to doubt their intelligence. In order to prove their mathematical abilities and worth to the school, to the ETS, and to the nation, the students agree to retake the test at the end of the summer, months after their last class. The students are given only one day to prepare and Escalante gravely tells them that the test will be harder than the first. The students all pass and Escalante tells the school principal that he wants his students' original scores reinstated.

==In popular culture==
The 2008 ''[[South Park]]'' episode &quot;[[Eek, A Penis!]]&quot; parodied the film, with character [[Eric Cartman]] altering his appearance to resemble the film's version of Escalante, dubbing himself &quot;Mr. Cartmanez&quot; and gaining a job in a mostly Hispanic inner-city school in order to teach the students to cheat their way to success, &quot;the white people way&quot;.

In the 2000 HBO film ''[[Cheaters (film)|Cheaters]]'', the ending scene from Escalante's defense is copied in order to defend their cheating the state academic decathlon.

'''Autodesk Maya''' is a software application used for [[3D animation]], [[3D modeling]], simulation, visual effects, [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]], [[match moving]], and [[compositing]]. It is developed in [[Toronto]] by [[Autodesk]]'s [[Autodesk Media and Entertainment|Media and Entertainment Division]] (formerly [[Alias Systems Corporation|Alias]]).

Maya is used in the [[film]] and [[television|TV industry]], as well as for [[Video game|computer and video games]], architectural visualization and design.

The product is named after [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]], the [[Sanskrit]] term for &quot;illusion.&quot;

==History==
{{See|Maya release history}}

Maya is the culmination of three 3D software lines: Wavefront's The Advanced Visualizer (in California), Thomson Digital Image (TDI) Explore (in France) and Alias' Power Animator (in Canada). In 1993 Wavefront purchased TDI, and in 1995 [[Silicon Graphics|Silicon Graphics Incorporated]] (SGI) purchased both Alias and Wavefront (due to pressure from [[Microsoft]]'s purchase of [[Softimage (company)|Softimage]] earlier that year) and combined them into one working company, producing a single package from their collective source code. The combined company was referred to as [[Alias Systems Corporation|Alias{{!}}Wavefront]]. In the mid-1990s, the most popular pipeline in Hollywood films was a combination of tools: Alias Studio for modeling, [[Softimage 3D|Softimage{{pipe}}3D]] for animation, and [[PhotoRealistic RenderMan]] for rendering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://silicon-valley.siggraph.org/MeetingNotes/ILM.html |title=Jurassic Park - The Illusion of Life}}&lt;/ref&gt; This combination was used for numerous films, such as [[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]], [[The Abyss]] and ''[[Terminator 2: Judgement Day]]''. It took Alias|Wavefront two more years after the merger to release Maya.

Both Alias and Wavefront were working on their next generation of software at the time of the merger. Alias had taken a Macintosh product, &quot;[[Alias Sketch|Alias Sketch!]]&quot;, moved it to the SGI platform and added many features to it. The code name for this project was Maya. Maya was developed in close collaboration with Walt Disney Feature Animation, during the production of ''[[Dinosaur (film)|Dinosaur]]'', and the GUI was all customizable as a requirement from Disney so they could set up their own GUI and workflow based on decades of animation experience. This had a large impact on the openness of Maya and later also helped the software become an industry standard, since many facilities implement extensive proprietary customization of the software to gain competitive advantage.

It was then decided to adopt Alias' &quot;Maya&quot; architecture, and merge Wavefront's code with it.

In the early days of development, Maya started with [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]], then moved to [[Tcl]] as the scripting language, in order to leverage its similarity to the Unix shell language. Sophia, the scripting language in Wavefront's [[Dynamation (software)|Dynamation]], was eventually chosen as the basis of MEL, and helped eased integration of other Wavefront technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= In silico: 3D animation and simulation of cell biology with Maya and MEL|last=Sharpe |first=  Jason Sharpe|coauthors=Charles J. Lumsden, Nicholas Woolridge |year= 2008|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|  page=263|isbn= 0-1237-3655-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon its release in 1998, Alias|Wavefront discontinued all previous animation-based software lines including Alias Power Animator, encouraging consumers to upgrade to Maya. It succeeded in expanding its product line to take over a great deal of market share, with leading visual effects companies such as [[Industrial Light and Magic]] and [[Tippett Studio]] switching from [[Softimage]] to Maya for the animation software.

Later, Alias|Wavefront was renamed Alias. In 2003, Alias was sold by SGI to the [[Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan]] and the private equity investment firm [[Accel-KKR]]. In October 2005, Alias was sold again, this time to [[Autodesk]], and on January 10, 2006, Autodesk completed the acquisition and ''Alias'' Maya is now known as '''Autodesk Maya'''.

In 2003, Maya won an Academy Award &quot;for scientific and technical achievement&quot;, citing use &quot;on nearly every feature using 3-D computer-generated images.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scientific and Technical Achievements Honored with Academy Awards|url=http://www.oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2003/03.01.06.html|date=2003-01-06|accessdate=2009-10-01}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[Image:Autodesk Maya 2010 App Icon.png|70px|left]] Maya is a popular, [[node]]-based 3D software suite, evolved from [[Wavefront Technologies|Wavefront]] Explorer and [[Alias Systems Corporation|Alias]] [[PowerAnimator]] using technologies from both. The software used to be released in two versions: Maya Complete and Maya Unlimited; but is now sold as one software.

Maya was originally released for the [[IRIX]] operating system, and subsequently ported to the [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Linux]], and [[Mac OS X]] operating systems. IRIX support was discontinued after the release of version 6.5. When Autodesk acquired Alias in October 2005, they continued Maya development. The latest version, 2011 (12.0), was released in April 2010.

An important feature of Maya is its openness to third-party software, which can strip the software completely of its standard appearance and, using only the [[Geometric modeling kernel|kernel]], transform it into a highly customized version of the software. This feature in itself made Maya appealing to large studios, which tend to write custom code for their productions using the provided [[software development kit]].

A [[Tcl]]-like cross-platform scripting language called ''[[Maya Embedded Language]]'' (''MEL'') is provided not only as a scripting language, but as means to customize Maya's core functionality (much of the environment, commands, and tools are written in the language).  Additionally, user interactions are implemented and recorded as MEL scripting code which users can store on a custom [[toolbar]], allowing animators to add functionality without experience in [[C (programming language)|C]] or [[C++]], though that option is provided with the software development kit. Support for [[Python (programming language)|Python]] scripting was added in version 8.5.

The core of Maya itself is written in [[C++]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.research.att.com/~bs/applications.html List of C++ applications], maintained by C++ creator [[Bjarne Stroustrup]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to standard Maya Binary (.mb extension) scenes, project files can be stored as sequences of MEL operations saved as a human-readable file (.ma, for &quot;Maya [[ASCII]]&quot;). Containing all geometry and animation data, these files are editable in any text editor outside of the Maya environment, thus allowing for a high level of flexibility when working with external tools.

A [[pie menu|marking menu]] is built into larger menu system called Hotbox that provides instant access to a majority of features in Maya at the press of a key.

==Modeling==
[[File:Airbus A300 CGI.jpg|thumb|An example render of a Maya scene.]]
[[Nonuniform rational B-spline|NURBS]], [[Polygon (computer graphics)|polygons]] and [[subdivision surface]]s (or SubDivs or SubD's) are available in Maya.

Polygons are a widely used model medium due to its relative stability and functionality. Polygons are also the visualization bridge between NURBS and SubDivs. NURBS are used for their ready-smooth appearance and respond well to deformations in the Dynamics Workbench.  SubDivs resemble a combination of both NURBS and polygons, but they are actually just a smoothed mesh.&lt;ref&gt;Pisca, Nicholas. ''YSYT - Maya MEL Basics for Designers'', pp 53-54. 0001d Publishing. 2009&lt;/ref&gt; They are ready-smooth and can be manipulated like polygons, resulting in a model of many objects including hands, faces, and other multi-topological constructions. Maya hair tools cannot be applied to subdivision polygons without previous conversion.

==Dynamics and simulation==
Maya features a [[particle system]] for handling masses like steam and water drops. Dynamic fields allow adding gravity, wind and vortexes, allowing for effects such as blowing leaves or even tornadoes. Special tools give artists the ability to brush and style particles like hair and fur. This module is a direct evolution of [[Wavefront Technologies|Wavefront]] [[Dynamation (software)|Dynamation]].

An artist may create [[rigid body]] geometric objects which collide automatically without explicit animation, as well as [[soft body]] objects which can ripple and bend, like                    flags and cloth.

Maya effects are built-in programs that make it easy for users to create complex animation effects such as smoke, fire and realistic water effects, with many options and attributes for tuning the results.

In version 8.5 a powerful cloth simulator called &quot;nCloth&quot; was added, allowing users to simulate cloth with control over aspects such as self-collision and interpenetration. The cloth objects can be modified to behave as rigid or soft bodies.

In version 2009, &quot;nParticles&quot; were added, offering a new particle simulation system (based around the same system running 'nCloth'), in addition to the original particle system available in Maya.  This addition was similar to the inclusion of &quot;nCloth&quot; alongside &quot;Maya Cloth&quot;, insofar as it did not take the place of any existing dynamic tools, despite being newer. (see 'Unlimited Features' below).

==Maya software==
Maya now comes in one version (replacing Maya Unlimited).  Maya Complete has been discontinued.  The new Maya contains all the features of Maya Unlimited 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/pc/compare/index?siteID=123112&amp;id=13583751 |title=Autodesk Maya Features - Compare}}&lt;/ref&gt;:
;Maya Fluid Effects
:A realistic fluid simulator (effective for smoke, fire, clouds and explosions, added in Maya 4.5)
;Maya Classic Cloth
:Cloth simulation to automatically simulate clothing and fabrics moving realistically over an animated character. The Maya Cloth toolset has been upgraded in every version of Maya released after Spider-Man 2. Alias worked with Sony Pictures Imageworks to get Maya Cloth up to scratch for that production, and all those changes have been implemented, although the big studios opted to use third party plugins such as [[Syflex]] instead of the (relatively) cumbersome Maya Cloth.
;Maya Fur
:Animal fur simulation similar to Maya Hair. It can be used to simulate other fur-like objects, such as grass.
;Maya Hair
:A simulator for realistic-looking human hair implemented using curves and Paint Effects. These are also known as dynamic curves.
;Maya Live
:A set of motion tracking tools for CG matching to clean plate footage.
;Maya nCloth
:Added in version 8.5, nCloth is the first implementation of Maya Nucleus, Autodesk's simulation framework. nCloth gives the artist further control of cloth and material simulations.
;Maya nParticle
:Added in version 2009, nParticle is addendum to Maya Nucleus toolset. nParticle is for simulating a wide range of complex 3D effects, including liquids, clouds, smoke, spray, and dust.
;MatchMover
:Added to Maya 2010, this enables compositing of CGI elements with motion data from video and film sequences.
;Maya Composite
:Added to Maya 2010,this was earlier sold as [[Toxik]].
;Camera Sequencer: 
:Added after Maya unlimited 2009, Camera Sequencer is used to layout multiple camera shots and manage them in one animation sequence. 
==Scripting and plugins==
In Maya, all attributes are parametric, meaning anything can be connected to anything (e.g. a color intensity of a shader can be used to control the movement of a door opening and closing). To control the node-based system of Maya, its fully reconfigurable user interface can be scripted with [[Maya Embedded Language|MEL]] script code which can be dropped onto a shelf to create a new icon that executes that code.

With the release of Maya 8.5 support for the [[Python (programming language)|Python scripting language]] has been included. The current implementation of Python in Maya is not fully object oriented though.
*[[List of Maya plugins]]

===MEL scripting===
Maya has an embedded script language called MEL, [[Maya Embedded Language]], which is similar to TCL and Perl programming. Code written in MEL can be executed from the script editor, shelves, and drop down menus.

MEL affords more access and control than what was designed in the User Interface; some functions of the software and advanced options are only available by using MEL programming.
All Maya preferences, commands, toolbars, and drop down menus are MEL code. By recording from the Script Editor History Window or scanning the Maya Program Files directory, it is possible to retrieve the original MEL procedures and functions.

MEL is not object oriented, so it is impossible to create custom classes and methods as you would in C++ or Python.
The advantage of this is that it gives MEL a strong structure making it accessible and easier to understand to Maya users and to first time programmers.
Also the linear scripting nature of the language would assist the user in making the most of the Maya nodes instead of tempting him/her to make their own objects, as in case of object oriented languages.

==Learning tools==
Along with the history of Maya the company has produced Maya learning tools which date back to the earlier Alias days. Beginning with an internally produced newsletter on Maya software techniques and workflows, the company continued with the internally produced Art of Maya book and training videos and tutorials. In response to strong user demand the company's education department further developed instructional books and video-based learning content referred to as learning tools. Autodesk continues to develop learning tools with content developed both by internal product specialists as well as industry professionals. The company's video-based learning tools have recently moved away from physical production and are now available as digital downloads.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

==Use in films==
Many popular computer-animated films have been made with Maya software, including ''[[Resident Evil: Degeneration]]'', ''[[Ice Age (film series)|Ice Age]]'', its sequel ''[[Ice Age: The Meltdown]]'', ''[[Geng: The Adventure Begins]]'', ''[[Monsters vs. Aliens]]'', ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'', and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://images.autodesk.com/adsk/files/dreamworks_animation_skg_customer_story.pdf |title=Dreamworks SKG and Maya}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alias Systems Corporation''' (formerly '''Alias|Wavefront'''), headquartered in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]], was a [[software]] company that produced high-end [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]] software.  The company was formed in 1995 when [[Silicon Graphics]] bought Alias Research, which was founded in 1983, and [[Wavefront Technologies]], founded in 1984, then merged the two companies.  It is now owned by [[Autodesk]], the producers of [[AutoCAD]] and [[3ds Max]].

== History ==

Alias' best known product, the 3D modeling and animation package [[Maya (software)|Maya]], was delivered in 1998 and has released a major upgrade every 9-12 months. The last release made by Alias was Maya 7.0. Since the purchase by Autodesk all versions after 8.5 use a year-based naming convention, e.g. Maya2008.  Other significant products include; the industrial design package [[StudioTools]] (formerly known as Studio, or just &quot;Alias&quot;), which is used extensively in the automotive, aerospace and industrial design industries, a 2D drawing and sketching application called [[Autodesk SketchBook Pro|SketchBook Pro]], and back in 1992, an early Macintosh based 3D modelling and rendering package called Sketch!, etc.

On March 1, 2003, the company was honored by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] with an Oscar for scientific and technical achievement for their development of [[Maya (software)|Maya]] software. [[Wavefront Technologies]] founders [[Bill Kovacs]] and Roy A. Hall received a 1997 [[Academy Award]] for the creative leadership (Kovacs) and the principal engineering (Hall) efforts that led to the Wavefront Advanced Visualizer computer graphics system.

Later in 2003, the company's name was changed from ''Alias|Wavefront'' to ''Alias''. In June 2004, Silicon Graphics sold Alias to 
the [[Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan]] and [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts|Accel-KKR]], a technology-focused private equity investment firm, for [[United States dollar|US$]]57.1 million.  In September 2004, Alias acquired Kaydara, adding the company's character animation and motion editing products to Alias' line of software.

=== Acquisition by Autodesk ===

On October 4, 2005, [[Autodesk]], makers of [[3ds Max]] and [[AutoCAD]] drafting software, announced plans to acquire Alias in a cash acquisition valued at [[United States dollar|US$]]182 million.  On January 10, 2006, Autodesk completed the acquisition of Alias for US$197 million in cash.{{Fact|date=August 2008}}

'''''The Inquirer''''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Tech tabloid|technology tabloid]] website founded by [[Mike Magee (journalist)|Mike Magee]] after his departure from ''[[The Register]]'' (of which he was one of the founding members) in 2001. Mike Magee later left The Inquirer in February, 2008 to work on the ''[[IT Examiner]]''.

The magazine is entirely Internet-based with its journalists living all over the world and filing copy online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=33419 The Inquirer, 2 August 2006: ''All journalism will be Indian journalism one day''] (cited 23 August 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing style==

The site hews to ''[[The Register]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s slogan, &quot;Biting the hand that feeds IT&quot; (later changed to &quot;Sci/Tech News for the World&quot;), and is known for its early access to industry news based on insider sources.  When served with &quot;[[cease and desist]]&quot; orders, the website sometimes publishes them in full, with commentary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=11474 The Inquirer, 10 September 2003: ''US Republican Party threatens to sue the INQUIRER''] (cited 23 August 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; It has also recently started publishing information regarding hardware available in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[United States|USA]], [[France]] and other countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=32623 The Inquirer, 25 June 2006: ''Mio C710 will tell you where you are''] (cited 23 August 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Inquirer''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s articles are written in a subjective and opinionated tone, with much the same style of reporting common in British tabloid newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=13072 The Inquirer, 7 December 2003: ''Last week's top INQUIRER stories''] (cited 23 August 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; In the English version of the site, [[slang]] terms, particularly those common to the [[United Kingdom]], are used.  On each visit to the main page of the website, ''The Inquirer'' shows a random comment or quote (usually sarcastic) at the top of the page.

''The Inquirer'' has a diverse writing staff coming from many different countries, with Rob Coppinger being the news editor as of 4 May 2010 and Madeline Bennett the overall editor since June 2009 [http://www.theinquirer.net/static/aboutus]. Paul Hales left at that time. Some people&lt;ref&gt;For example [http://dc.2cpu.com/story.php?id=2472#8 2CPU.com forum, 11 April 2003: ''Serverworks and Supermicro to Support AMD Opteron!''] (cited 5 February 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that several of ''The Inquirer''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s writers are actually [[pseudonym]]s. Among these are Adamson Rust, an [[anagram]] of [[Nostradamus]], and Eva Glass, an anagram of [[Las Vegas metropolitan area|Las Vegas]] suggesting that these names are really pseudonyms of other staff members. ''Inquirer'' writer [[Charlie Demerjian]], who uses the nickname ''Groo_'' on the Ace's Hardware [[Internet forum|messageboard]], more or less confirms this in one of his posts there.[http://www.aceshardware.com/forums/read_post.jsp?id=120064735&amp;forumid=1]

==&quot;Everywhere Girl&quot;==
''The Inquirer'' has run a series of stories about the &quot;Everywhere Girl&quot;, a model thus referred to by the publication due to [[stock photo]]s of her appearing in a large number of different advertisements, particularly advertisements of technology companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=17778 The Inquirer, 10 August 2004: ''Everywhere Dell girl appears in Germany''] (cited 29 January 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scoops==

Despite getting scoops, some of the reporters for ''The Inquirer'' have a policy against signing non-disclosure agreements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=2745 The Inquirer, 5 March 2002: ''The INQUIRER, Intel, embargoes and NDAs''] (cited 23 August 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The publication has various connections with the industry; Intel in particular has acknowledged that its staff have a tendency to send details of meetings to ''The Inquirer''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=20000 The Inquirer, 2 December 2004: ''Intel wonders how INQUIRER gets leaks so fast''] (cited 23 August 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of ''The Inquirer''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s articles include information unconfirmed by official sources within the companies they report on.  When dealing with such information, they typically preface the article with a statement such as the following, &quot;We've heard an odd, but strong whisper on the grapevine . . .&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=32990 The Inquirer, 12 July 2006: ''New iPods to use OLED displays''] (cited 23 August 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; These articles lack official confirmation and they can be considered as [[rumor]] or [[speculation]].

===Playstation 3 Graphics Processor===

As is the case with most publications, some stories published by ''The Inquirer'' cause controversy, such as a 31 August 2005 story about a claim that [[PlayStation 3]]'s [[GPU]] is less powerful than the [[GeForce 7800]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=25838 The Inquirer, 31 August 2005: ''Playstation 3 GPU &quot;slightly less powerful than GeForce 7800&quot;''] (cited 23 August 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; [[NVIDIA]], manufacturer of GeForce, responded to this claim&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.teamxbox.com/xbox/9132/PlayStation-3-GPU-More-Powerful-than-GeForce-7800/ Team Xbox, 31 August 2005: ''PlayStation 3 GPU More Powerful than GeForce 7800!''] (cited 23 August 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; by stating that the Playstation 3's [[RSX 'Reality Synthesizer'|RSX]] (which NVIDIA worked on) is faster than the GeForce 7800. While technically true, since the RSX has a higher core clock speed than the Nvidia 7800GTX, the RSX has other downgraded features (128-bit memory bus, 8 ROPS and 256MB memory) that ultimately makes it a less powerful GPU than the 7800GTX.

===Sony Laptop Battery Scandal===

One of ''The Inquirer''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s greatest scoops has been its reporting during 2006 of laptop battery problems that affected [[Dell]], [[Sony]] and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] as of September 2006, with rumours of problems at [[Toshiba]] and [[Lenovo Group|Lenovo]]. In June 2006, ''The Inquirer''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s report&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=32550 The Inquirer, 21 June 2006: ''Dell laptop explodes at Japanese conference''] (cited 2 September 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; and dramatic photographs of a Dell notebook PC exploding in flames at a conference in Japan attracted global media attention. Many renowned publications, such as ''[[The New York Times]]'', reprinted ''The Inquirer''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s photographs.[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/10/technology/10dell.html?ex=1310184000&amp;en=6e111c0c3fd846ac&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss] ''The Inquirer'' was also the first publication to report Dell's subsequent decision to recall all 4.1 million of the faulty batteries, according to ''[[BusinessWeek]]''.

''The Inquirer''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s successful reporting of the story relied on information supplied by readers and later by a confidential source at Dell. &quot;I attribute being on top of the story to old-fashioned print journalism standards — cultivating, and, if you'll excuse the pun, not burning such contacts,&quot; ''The Inquirer''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s founder, Mike Magee, told BusinessWeek.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/aug2006/tc20060830_642667.htm BusinessWeek, 30 August 2006: ''The Battery Recall: A Win for the Web''] (cited 2 September 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rydermark===

In July 2006, ''The Inquirer'' posted images to show cheating by [[NVIDIA]] Windows device drivers in ''Rydermark 2006''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1011446/rydermark-screenshots-back-california-graphics-fudge The Inquirer, 18 July 2006: ''Rydermark screenshots back California graphics fudge''] (cited 4 February 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The images were alleged to be fake by a number of sources.&lt;ref&gt;Such as [http://www.dailytech.com/article.aspx?newsid=3400 DailyTech, 19 July 2006: ''&quot;Rydermark&quot; Cheating Allegations Discredited''] (cited 23 August 2006), or [http://www.behardware.com/news/8269/the-inquirer-accuses-nvidia-of-cheating.html BeHardware, 19 July 2006: ''The Inquirer accuses Nvidia of cheating''] (cited 23 August 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Inquirer'' denied any wrongdoing and quoted the maker of Rydermark calling the allegations against them &quot;irresponsible&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=33131 The Inquirer, 19 July 2006: ''Rydermark maker labels hoax allegations 'irresponsible' ''] (cited 23 August 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; About 8 months after the original Rydermark article, ''The Inquirer'' ran another article claiming that Rydermark was still being developed, but was near release.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.theinquirer.net/?article=37716 The Inquirer, 19 February 2007: ''Rydermark benchmark lives. It's almost done''] (cited 28 February 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; In response, one of its critics offered $1,000 to a charity of the Rydermark articles author's choosing if he could produce (breaching his [[Non-disclosure agreement|NDA]]) a version of Rydermark that showed the alleged screenshots in full-motion video before a set deadline (which gave the author 10 and a half hours, beginning at 6:30PM UK time). No one produced the program before the deadline passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Kristopher| last=Kubicki | url=http://www.dailytech.com/article.aspx?newsid=6149 | title=DailyTech Digest: RyderMark, My take on RyderMark's newest incarnation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Independent verification that RyderMark was genuine, first appeared in TweakTown in May 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tweaktown.com/articles/1103/1/page_1_introduction/index.html, 16 May 2007: ''TweakTown: RyderMark Beta 2 Preview - Emerging competition for Futuremark?''] (cited 17 May 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  RyderMark developer Ajith Ram denied ever sending the Inquirer NVIDIA cheating allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Kristopher | last=Kubicki | url=http://www.dailytech.com/article.aspx?newsid=7396 | title=RyderMark Developer: We Never Said NVIDIA Cheated |publisher=DailyTech |accessdate=2007-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ATI Intel front side bus license revocation===

On 24 July 2006, ''The Inquirer'' wrote that, in response to AMD's announced intent to purchase ATI, &quot;ATI had its chipset license pulled, or at least not renewed by Intel.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=33225 The Inquirer, 24 July 2006: ''Intel pulls ATI bus licence''] (cited 23 August 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; ATI responded by stating that its license had not been revoked and that they continue to ship Intel chipsets under license.&lt;ref&gt;[http://enthusiast.hardocp.com/article.html?art=MTEyNSwxLCxoZW50aHVzaWFzdA== H Enthusiast, 26 July 2006: ''AMD &amp; ATI Answers to Rumormongering''] (cited 23 August 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 August 2006, ATI showed its chipset roadmap to motherboard vendors which showed that next-generation chipsets for the Intel platform are cancelled [http://www.xbitlabs.com/news/chipsets/display/20060823235224.html as X-bit Labs reported]. On 1 March 2007, AMD said that they will continue developing chipsets for Intel platforms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitimes.com/NewsShow/MailHome.asp?datePublish=2007/3/1&amp;pages=PD&amp;seq=214 DigiTimes, 1 March 2007: ''AMD keeping open platform strategy: Q&amp;A with sales and marketing vice president Jochen Polster''] (cited 3 March 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''''Revolutionary Girl Utena'''''|少女革命ウテナ|Shōjo Kakumei Utena}} is a [[manga]] by [[Chiho Saito]] and [[anime]] directed by [[Kunihiko Ikuhara]]. The manga serial began in the June 1996 issue of [[Ciao (magazine)|Ciao]] and the [[anime]] was first broadcast in 1997. A movie, {{Nihongo|&quot;Adolescence of Utena&quot;|少女革命ウテナ アドゥレセンス黙示録|Shōjo Kakumei Utena Aduresensu Mokushiroku|literally &quot;Revolutionary Girl Utena Adolescence Apocalypse&quot;}} was released in theatres in 1999.  A number of stage productions based on the franchise were also produced in the mid 1990s, including the &quot;[[musical comedy|Comedie Musicale]] Utena la fillette révolutionnaire&quot;, staged by an all-female [[Takarazuka]]-style cast.

The [[main character]] is Utena Tenjou, a tomboyish teenage girl who was so impressed by a kind prince in her childhood that she decided to become a prince herself (expressed in her manner of dress and personality).  She attends Ohtori Academy, where she meets a student named Anthy Himemiya, a girl who is in an abusive relationship with another student. Utena fights to protect Anthy and is pulled into a series of sword duels with the members of the Student Council. Anthy is referred to as the &quot;Rose Bride&quot; and is given to the winner of each duel.  As Anthy is thought to be the key to a coming revolution, the current champion is constantly challenged for the right to possess the Rose Bride.

While the show generally has the appearance of a [[magical girl]] series, it is also highly [[metaphysics|metaphysical]], [[Surrealism|surreal]], and [[allegory|allegorical]].  It contains a mix of borrowed visuals from [[Takarazuka Revue|Takarazuka]] theater, [[shadow play|shadow puppetry]], and classic [[shōjo manga]].

The [[anime]] and [[manga]] were created simultaneously, but, despite some similarities, they progressed in different directions.

==Composition==
The ''Utena'' franchise was conceived by [[BePapas]], a production group composed of talents from various corners of the manga and anime universe. Most notably, the 39-episode ''Revolutionary Girl Utena'' TV series was created by some of the same production staff responsible for ''[[Sailor Moon]]'', including writer and director [[Kunihiko Ikuhara]]. Ikuhara was already well known for his role in the production of ''Sailor Moon'', including his contributions to the highly acclaimed third season, [[Sailor Moon S]]. The member of BePapas responsible for the manga version of ''Utena'' was [[Chiho Saito]], a well-established shōjo manga author. Though she and the other members of BePapas discussed concepts together, Saito had little influence on the direction of the anime. 

Ikuhara did not conceive of the idea for the movie, ''Adolescence of Utena'', until watching the final episodes of the television series on broadcast TV. Once again, BePapas convened to discuss concepts, and Saito would go on to create a manga adaptation of the film. The film can be interpreted either as the end of the story initiated by the TV series, or as a condensed retelling with the same themes and characters, although it goes in a very different direction. Its structure is in many ways parallel to that of the series, but the roles of the leads are subtly switched. If the television series riffs on themes from theater and mythology, it could be said that the movie riffs on themes from the series. Familiarity with the television series is assumed, and the movie version is even more visually bizarre than the original ''Utena'', enough so that it earned the good-natured nickname &quot;The End Of Utena&quot;, after the similarly abstract but much less cheerful ''[[The End of Evangelion]]''. &lt;!-- I hope nobody remove this comment. It gave me a good chuckle. --&gt;

Another incarnation of ''Utena'' came in the form of a number of one-shot theatrical productions. The  [[Takarazuka Revue|Takarazuka]]-style ''&quot;Musical Shōjo Kakumei Utena&quot;'', also known as &quot;Comedie Musicale Utena la fillette révolutionnaire&quot;, played in 1997, and the second disc of Shōjo Kakumei Utena OST 5, ''Engage Toi a Mes Contes''&lt;!-- Could we get a translation of that French? --&quot;Engage you with my stories&quot;?--&gt;, contains many of the songs from this musical. At [[Animazement]] '00, Ikuhara was said to be working on a later musical, ''&quot;Shōjo Kakumei Utena, Makai Tensei Mokushiroku hen, Reijin Nirvana Raiga&quot;'',  with the theatrical group [[Gesshoku Kageki Dan]]. &lt;!-- Probably was actually the 3rd musical; Reijin Nirvana Raiga was the 2nd. But I have failed to source this statement anyway. --&gt;

===English release===
The [[English language|English]] manga was serialized by [[Viz Media]] in the ''[[Animerica Extra]]'' magazine and later published into five trade paperbacks, with an additional volume for the film adaptation. [[Enoki Films]] holds the American license to the anime and called the series ''Ursula's Kiss'', and gave each character English names. However the American distributor, [[Central Park Media]], chose to use the original title and character names. The dubbed and subbed versions were released to [[VHS]] in 1998 by [[Central Park Media|Software Sculptors]]. There were a total of four releases each containing either three or four episodes. These same episodes were released to two bilingual [[DVD]] volumes in 1999 with six or seven episodes each. These DVDs were known as the ''Rose Collection''. However after releasing the first thirteen episodes to VHS and DVD, Central Park Media had difficulties licensing the remaining twenty-six episodes and the dub was put on hiatus despite that the VHS Tapes and DVDs were selling well. Central Park Media eventually licensed ''Adolescence of Utena'' and released it to a dubbed only VHS and a bilingual DVD in 2001 under the title, ''Utena: The Movie''. After settling all legal issues, Software Sculptors  released the remaining twenty-six episodes of the anime series to bilingual DVDs in 2002 and 2003, but these releases didn't sell as well as the previous ones. The entire series was later sold in the form of three DVD box sets. The first contained the first thirteen episodes and the movie, the second contained episodes fourteen to twenty-six, and the third contained the remaining thirteen episodes. However, all the DVD releases were discontinued early due to financial problems with Central Park Media. With the complete shutdown of [[Central Park Media]] and [[Central Park Media|Software Sculptors]], the distribution rights to the series were put up for liquidation. At [[Anime Expo]] 2010, [[The Right Stuf International]] had announced that they have rescued the ''Utena'' TV series and will re-release the series in 3 remastered packs in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2010-07-02/right-stuf-nozomi-adds-so-ra-no-wo-to-utena-tv|title=Right Stuf, Nozomi Adds So-Ra-No-Wo-To, Utena Tv|publisher= [[Anime News Network]]|date=2010-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
{{See also|List of Revolutionary Girl Utena episodes}}
The series is divided into four story arcs, in each of which Utena comes to face a different challenge at Ohtori Academy (Enoki Films calls it &quot;Otori Junior High School&quot;). In all of them, Utena must defend her title as the owner of the Rose Bride, with the intention of protecting Anthy. The duels almost always occur when someone with the Rose Crest ring challenges the current Engaged, though the Engaged may challenge other Duelists as well. No refusal is accepted. The matches occur in the dueling arena, a large, high platform in the academy's outskirts, which is only open to duelists. The Rose Bride pins [[rose]]s to the Duelists' jackets. They then swordfight, until one duelist wins by knocking away the opponent's rose with his or her blade.

(The story arc names below link to more details than given here as well as the episodes.) 

*'''[[List of Revolutionary Girl Utena episodes#Student Council Saga|Student Council Saga]]''' (Seitokai Hen)
:Episodes 1 to 13. This first part of the series introduces Utena, Anthy, and most of the main characters. It depicts how Utena ends up winning the Rose Bride, and her initial duels against the Student Council members. They in turn insist for various reasons on fighting in order to defeat Utena and win Anthy in order to gain the power to bring the World Revolution.

*'''[[List of Revolutionary Girl Utena episodes#Black Rose Saga|Black Rose Saga]]''' (Kurobara Hen)
:Episodes 14 to 24. After repelling the Student Council's attempts to take Anthy, Utena faces another obstacle, Souji Mikage. Disguised as a genius 18-year-old school counselor, he uses his powers of persuasion and knowledge of psychology to put people under his control by coaxing them to confide their deepest hostilities and fears. Almost always, these people are students whose problems stem from conflict with Utena, Anthy, and the Student Council. He then sends them, wearing black Rose Crest rings on their fingers and frozen, black roses on their chests to fight Utena. This arc also introduces Akio Ohtori.

*'''[[List of Revolutionary Girl Utena episodes#Akio Ohtori Saga|Akio Ohtori Saga]]''' (Ōtori Akio Hen)
:Episodes 25 to 33. After solving the Mikage situation, Utena must fight each Student Council member again. At the same time, she finds herself the target of Akio's seduction. This creates a rift between her and Anthy. This arc is sometimes referred to by fans as the &quot;Akio Car Arc&quot; because each duelist is convinced to challenge Utena during a car ride with Akio.

*'''[[List of Revolutionary Girl Utena episodes#End of World Saga|End of World Saga]]''' (Mokushiroku Hen)
:Episodes 34 to 39. As the conflict escalates, the dark secrets of the duels, and Akio and Anthy's true intentions behind them, are unveiled.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:AnthyHimemiya.jpg|thumb|right|Anthy Himemiya]] --&gt;
{{details|List of Revolutionary Girl Utena characters|the characters}}
&lt;!--If you want to add more on any character, please consider adding it in the list linked above. The characters section in this article is a summarised version of the list above.--&gt;
;{{nihongo|Utena Tenjou |天上 ウテナ|''Tenjō Utena''}}
:Utena is a [[tomboy]]ish, courageous and naïve character who lives to emulate the idealized prince figure from her childhood. She is forthright, honest, and friendly. Nearly all the girls in school idolize her. She both subverts and conforms to the stereotypes she embodies as a noble warrior and a naive magical girl in danger of becoming a damsel in distress. The series chronicles her journey to protect her friend Anthy and become a truly noble Prince. Her Dueling Rose is white.
;{{nihongo|Anthy Himemiya |姫宮 アンシー|''Himemiya Anshī''}}
:A mysterious, shy girl whose [[wiktionary:vapid|vapid]] expression and [[superficial]] politeness mask a complex, darker personality. She is said to have no thoughts or desires besides that of what her master expect of her. Because of her &quot;doormat&quot; behavior, other characters tend to project their wants or desires onto her, and she's always the target of their eventual rage. Her past and current personality are simultaneously tragic and sinister, and her personality shifts between selfless love, passive-aggressiveness, cruelty, and learned helplessness. Like Utena, Anthy also subverts and conforms to the stereotypes she embodies as both a damsel in distress and a witch.

;{{nihongo|Akio Ohtori|鳳 暁生|''Ōtori Akio''}}
:Anthy's older brother, the acting chairman of the academy, and the closest character to a main antagonist that this series has. Although almost non-present in the first season of the show, he later plays a pivotal role in the second and third seasons. His given name derives from the Japanese name for [[Venus]], the Morning Star, which is identified with [[Lucifer]].

===Student council===
;{{nihongo|Juri Arisugawa |有栖川 樹璃 |''Arisugawa Juri''}}
:The captain of the academy's fencing team, Juri is one of Ohtori's most highly respected students, and even the teachers appear to be in awe of her. Her aloof, intimidating manner belies a dark secret. Of the Student Council Duellists, she is thought to be the most noble, and thus the one with the most potential to become a Prince, but her nobility and the strength that comes with it are constantly undermined by her desires and despair. Her Dueling Rose is orange.

;{{nihongo|Miki Kaoru |薫 幹|''Kaoru Miki''}}
:Miki is an ingenuous and polite seventh grader who befriends Utena, despite their role as possible opponents in the duels. He is especially known for his skill with the piano. In spite (or because of) his genius, he is lonely, sheltered, and insecure, and seeks a person who is just as pure and talented as him. In the anime he has a crush on Anthy, whereas in the manga he has a crush on Utena. His Dueling Rose is light blue.

;{{nihongo|Touga Kiryuu |桐生 冬芽 |''Kiryū Tōga''}}
:President of the Student Council and Ohtori's resident playboy, Touga is an arrogant and handsome young man whose desire to be powerful drives him to cruel and unscrupulous deeds. He is the only regular Council Member who deliberately involves himself in Akio's plans. Despite his talent and intelligence, Touga eventually realizes that he's nowhere near as influential as Akio or strong as Utena, and this causes him to change his ways as he tries to discover a new method to gain power. His Dueling Rose is red.

;{{nihongo|Nanami Kiryuu |桐生 七実 |''Kiryū Nanami''}}
:Touga's dramatic little sister, often used as comic relief throughout the series. Her love for her brother borders on obsession and incest, and she is often seen using devious means to punish the people who take her brother's attentions away from her. Though her motivations are considered the simplest and least ambitious out of all the Duelists, they are no less real to her, and she suffers just as much as all the other Student Council members throughout the series. Her Dueling Rose is yellow.

;{{nihongo|Kyouichi Saionji|西園寺 莢一 |''Saionji Kyōichi''}}
:Vice-president of the Student Council and captain of the [[kendo]] team. He is temperamental, egotistic, prone to angry rages, and often cruel. His lack of self-control stems from insecurity, a lifelong rivalry against Touga from which he is always at the losing end, and the fear that everyone and everything he knows will eventually die. He is obsessed with Anthy because he views the Rose Bride as a mindless doll who will never disobey him, and thus be with him forever. His Dueling Rose is green.

; {{nihongo|Ruka Tsuchiya |土谷 瑠果 |''Tsuchiya Ruka''}}
: A master swordsman, Ruka is the former captain of the fencing team and a former member of the Student Council. His cunning, manipulative behavior belies a hidden desperation to live, and his influence on Juri becomes one of the major turning points for her character. His Dueling Rose is dark blue.

===Black Rose Duellists===
;{{nihongo|Souji Mikage |御影 草時| ''Mikage Sōji''}}
:Mikage is the pink-haired head of the popular Mikage Seminar at Ohtori Academy. He wishes to kill Anthy and install a gravely ill boy, Mamiya, as the Rose Bride in order to save him from terminal illness. Mikage uses manipulation and psychology to control students close to the Council members in order to create a Duelist who can beat Utena.

;{{nihongo|Kanae Ohtori|鳳 香苗|''Ōtori Kanae''}}
:Akio's fiancee, daughter of the school's Trustee Chairman. She has a strained relationship with Anthy, who she finds 'creepy and intolerable'. Though she loves Akio very much, she feels distant from him and becomes the first Black Rose Duelist.

;{{nihongo|Kozue Kaoru|薫 梢 |''Kaoru Kozue''}}
:Miki's twin sister, Kozue feels overshadowed by her brother's talents and reacts by sleeping with many different men. She's extremely possessive of Miki to the point where she physically hurts anyone who tries to hurt or &quot;steal&quot; him.

;{{nihongo|Shiori Takatsuki|高槻 枝織| Takatsuki Shiori}}
:Shiori is the catalyst for Juri's current broken state of mind. She simultaneously idolizes Juri for her brilliance and despises her for it. Her extreme lack of self-worth is the reason for the rocky relationship between the two, and it reaches a breaking point when Ruka re-enters Ohtori academy.

;{{nihongo|Mitsuru Tsuwabuki|石路 美蔓| ''Tsuwabuki Mitsuru''}}
:Nanami's most devoted lackey, a boy in fourth grade.  He is obsessed with serving Nanami and wishes to be her adored &quot;brother&quot;. He is extremely confused about love, sex, and adulthood in general. His fruitless attempts to experiment makes him a Black Rose Duelist.

;{{nihongo|Wakaba Shinohara |篠原 若葉| ''Shinohara Wakaba''}}
:Wakaba is the most outwardly cheerful person in the series and is Utena's best friend, but she feels surrounded by &quot;special&quot; people and doesn't know how to become special herself. She is a co-dependent person who's only happy when she takes care of people because she doesn't feel like she has any other talents.

;{{nihongo|Keiko Sonoda|苑田 茎子|''Sonoda Keiko''}}
:Keiko is one of Nanami's sidekicks, who follow her only because she has a crush on Touga. Her jealousy, though as simple as Nanami's is strong enough for Mikage to take advantage of her mind.

==Themes==
&lt;!-- Suggestion; if you want to reference this stuff, start here: http://www.corneredangel.com/amwess/series.html --&gt;
With its plays on such archetypal figures as the [[Prince]], the [[Princess]], or the [[Witch]], and by the literary [[symbol]]ic role carried out by such plot elements as ''coffins'', ''thorns'', or ''castles'', ''Utena'' can be seen as the quintessence of the [[Postmodernist]] [[fairy tale]]. One important aspect of ''Revolutionary Girl Utena'' is that it grabs traditional ideas and perceptions, and twists them around. For example, it is often debated-and indirectly shown, in the series that Anthy and Utena are both the princesses of ''the prince'' who is Dios, or Akio, or both. This is in stark contrast to the generally accepted trope that princes have only ''one'' princess, whom they unfailingly love and protect. Dios and Akio are both shown to be protective of Utena and Anthy in their own way but are incapable of doing it properly. Dios' self-destructive altruism leads to Anthy's position as the Rose Bride, his existence as a powerless spirit, and the creation of Akio. As for Akio himself, it is debated how much he really cares for Utena or Anthy, but his ambition and lust for power ultimately overrides any love he might have felt for them both. 

It should be noted that the series invokes sexual themes quite often (especially in the final arc), some of which are [[incest]]uous desire, actual incest, and [[sexual abuse]]. While these themes are often important within the narrative, they are usually not directly stated or shown in the series. There is somewhat more explicit sexual imagery in the motion picture, although it is still far from [[pornography|pornographic]]. The omnipresence of [[phallic symbol]]s, such as swords, towers, and cars, and the sexual connotation of dewy petaled [[flower]]s contributes to the sense of urgent sexuality, repressed and otherwise, in the series.

Another very important and recurrent theme is of [[gender role]]s (freely chosen or socially imposed), which play a large part in the series, from its very premise in which Utena wishes to be a prince and not a princess.  As problematised as ''gender'' is in ''Utena'', sexual desire itself is quite fluid; most characters at least hint at having both same-sex and opposite-sex attractions.&lt;ref&gt;http://ohtori.nu/analysis/06_sex,_torment,_and_body_language.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ohtori.nu/analysis/04_sex_and_the_sinner.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Chief among the romantic relationships in ''Utena'' is that between Utena and Anthy. It is subtle in the TV series, but less ambiguous in the movie - the director has a dislike of the strong [[Shipping (fandom)|shipper]] tendency in fandom and even complained about ''[[Sailor Moon]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s leads' idealized relationship. While Utena (especially in the movie) is boyish, strong, and physically aggressive (&quot;masculine&quot; traits), she is more emotional and innocent than the wearily experienced Anthy.

Much of the series—arguably, in a way the entire series—revolves around the transition between childhood and adulthood, and all that implies, notably development of sexual feelings and identity and the loss of &quot;innocence&quot;. Most of the characters are estranged from a loved one in their childhood, something which affects them deeply and arguably stunts them, and this relationship is often complicated or corrupted by a sexual element.&lt;ref&gt;http://ohtori.nu/analysis/07_rhyaniwyn_monomyth.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Another theme of ''Utena'' is the reinterpretation of classic [[shōjo manga]] themes and motifs. Examples may be seen in the failure of &quot;heroic&quot; male characters, Utena's refusal to become a princess (and refusal to sacrifice her femininity in order to become a 'prince'), Anthy's subversion of the demure female role, and various plays on conventions in the genre, such as the transformation of outfits and idealized notions of friendship and love.

==Visual motifs==
[[Image:OhtoriAcademy.jpg|right|thumb|Some of ''Utena'''s architecture.]]
The dominant motif of the entire series is the rose, which fills the decor and landscape of the Academy as well as the ritual accoutrements of the Duelists. Highly stylized, they are reminiscent of [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]]'s work. 

Another motif is the use of elevators, which are used as places of transition or transformation. These include the Council's elevator, the one found in Nemuro Hall (scene of the confessions in the Black Rose arc), and the one found in the final version of the dueling arena. 

Cars may be considered one of the most oblique motifs seen in the series. In the anime, they appear in the third version of the dueling arena. In the final act of the movie, Utena is transformed into a car.

Repeated use of animated sequences can be seen in almost every episode, most noticeably Utena's entrance to the dueling arena. While this is usually seen in anime as a practical consideration to reduce production costs, it may also be used to reinforce certain themes.

''Utena'' also takes the typically [[shōjo manga]] poses and dramatic effects intended to heighten the mood or tension of important scenes and exaggerates them, often to the point of being deliberately comedic. Examples include characters framed with spinning roses, or a dramatic scene accentuated with a baseball match in the background.

The colour red is used liberally throughout the series to symbolise the ambition of the characters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jrt.co.jp/yos/ikuniweb/ikuniweb_e/ikuniworks/utena/movie/m_intro2.html ikuniweb(EnglishVersion)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inspirations==
[[Riyoko Ikeda]]'s ''[[The Rose of Versailles]]'' has often been quoted as an established source of inspiration for the visual style of ''Utena'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://intersections.anu.edu.au/issue5/charlton_review.html Intersections: Review: Utena: Adolescence Mokushiroku&quot;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; (scenes involving sliding mirrors and unsupported staircases appear during character introspections in ''The Rose of Versailles'' while in ''Utena'' very similar scenes are part of the surreal landscape), although director Ikuhara has denied this on several occasions, including the director's commentary on the final DVD ''Finale'' of the American release. Nevertheless, similarities between the protagonists of ''The Rose of Versailles'' and ''Utena'' have been drawn by fans and reviewers alike, with Utena and Anthy often compared and contrasted with [[Oscar François de Jarjayes]] and [[List_of_The_Rose_of_Versailles_characters#Marie_Antoinette|Marie Antoinette]] due to their protector/princess relationship. Oscar and Utena are both feminist warrior-women who defy gender restrictions, have notable fighting skills, and form deep relationships with other women to the point of covert and overt romance. They both go through internal turmoil as they struggle to balance their desires for love with their needs for independence and dedication to their ideals, while other characters try to take their autonomy away from them, and they themselves are confused as to what it means to be women who dress and act like princely men. The two series share themes surrounding freedom, and the nature of human strengths and weaknesses, as well as plot devices revolving around swordfighting and symbolism in which the personalities of major characters are represented by roses. Visual similarities include the school uniforms of Utena and the Student Council, which bear striking similarities to the French military uniforms in Rose of Versailles.

''[[Oniisama e]]'', which, like Rose of Versailles was written by Riyoko Ikeda and directed by [[Osamu Dezaki]], has also been noted as an inspirational source for several thematic elements and visuals. It appears to be the source for several plot facets, characters and themes such as esoteric elitism within a school setting (the Sorority in Oniisama and the Student Council in Utena), bullying through verbal harassment and slapping, a controlling and deceiving authority, motifs such as that of a tree under which characters sometime meet, problems between friends when one of them is recruited into an elite and exclusive circle (Misonoo and Tomoko's friendship compared to Utena and Wakaba's), use of a piece of jewelry to symbolize and control obsessive lesbian feelings (Saint-Just's gold bracelet represents her passionate feelings for Fukikio while Juri's gold rose-embossed locket holds her picture/feelings for Shirori), ambiguous incestuous relations, musical pieces having intensely private and sentimental value, and existential themes such as the meaning of life if all people eventually die. Among others, the visual inspirations from Oniisama include architecture, hairstyles, and scenes involving roses such as a scene where petals overflow along with sheets of water from Fukiko's bathtub in Oniisama e and a scene in the Utena movie where roses and water overflow from an outcropping while Utena and Anthy dance.

[[Osamu Tezuka]]'s [[Ribon no Kishi]] (the story of a young princess cross-dressing as a knight) and ''[[Kanashimi no Belladonna]]'' may be other inspirations. During the duel preparation sequences, Utena's outfit changes slightly in a transformation sequence, a common trait of the [[magical girl]] genre, and one which Ikuhara himself used profusely in [[Sailor Moon]].

The music for the Student Council is strongly reminiscent of the ''Toccata and Fugue in D Minor'' by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], and the Student Council's oath appears to be paraphrased from [[Hermann Hesse]]'s [[Demian]].{{Citation}}

Ikuhara cites prolific playwright, poet, and director [[Shuji Terayama]] as a major influence.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Terayama was a long time collaborator with [[J.A. Seazer]], who wrote the music for his plays.  Ikuhara worked with Seazer for the most well known music of Utena.

Ikuhara stated that the concept for Revolutionary Girl Utena came from his 'End of The World' themed [[Sailor Moon SuperS: The Movie]]. Ikuhara's original ideas for the film were not used as he left prematurely following the producer.&lt;ref&gt;http://uranime.nekomusume.net/misc/ikuhara_interview.iphtml&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
The series' musical score, by [[J.A. Seazer]], is one of the show's most memorable features.  Utena's signature song is &quot;Zettai Unmei Mokushiroku&quot; (Absolute Destiny Apocalypse), which plays every time Utena makes her way to the dueling arena.  This song, along with those played during the duels, is composed in a choral [[Rock and roll|rock]] style. The music itself features [[polyphonic]] melodies and lyrics that often appear to be little more than themed words strung together.  While the show's creative team hasn't offered any official explanations of the lyrics, some fan websites suggest interpretations.

The non-vocal background music was composed by [[Shinkichi Mitsumune]], and is largely [[orchestral]] in character, though it often features significant [[jazz]] influences. One notable song is &quot;The Sunlit Garden,&quot; a recurring [[duet (music)|duet]] [[piano]] piece which plays during nostalgic scenes. Its ubiquity in the series makes it iconic in its own right.  Mitsumune also handled the arrangement of the first eight duel choruses.

The soundtrack of Adolescence of Utena is similar in style to the series, containing a mixture of orchestral pieces and choral rock. [[Masami Okui]]'s track, the J-pop ballad &quot;Toki ni Ai wa&quot; (At Times Love is...), is atypical of the series' sound, although it enjoys considerable popularity among fans.

==Movie==
''Adolescence of Utena'' was first conceived by director Kunihiko Ikuhara when the final episode of the television series was broadcast on Japanese television (TV Tokyo). BePapas reconvened and created a new vision of the ''Utena'' universe. The resulting film is ambiguous in its place within the ''Utena'' universe; though it functions as a separate continuity, much like the manga, it also refers to events in the television series frequently enough that it is confusing to those unfamiliar with the show. Ultimately, the film is plotted in such a way that it could be seen as a continuation of the series or an entirely new vision.

In a loose retelling of the ''Revolutionary Girl Utena'' TV series, Utena Tenjou arrives at Ohtori Academy, appearing to be a boy. She is accidentally swept up in a series of duels for the possession of the Rose Bride Anthy Himemiya and the power she supposedly holds. At the same time, Utena reunites with Touga Kiryuu, a friend and love from her childhood. It is later revealed that Touga died long ago. A belief among some fans is that the movie takes place in the land of the dead. Other key differences between the series and film include the absence of Nanami (save for a brief cameo in her cow incarnation) and the revelation that Akio is also dead before the film begins.

The film takes many themes from the series and either ramps up their intensity or turns them on an ear. For example, the latent sexual tension between Utena and Anthy in the series is far more overt in the film; it is made clear to the viewer that Anthy is not only a &quot;bride&quot; by name, but that she will sleep with the person to whom she is engaged, regardless of whether they are male or female, including her brother. The concept of Ohtori as a prison is made clearer, and Utena's empowerment of Anthy to escape is given physical manifestation as Utena literally transforms into a car for Anthy to ride to freedom.

==Video game==
{{Nihongo title|Shōjo Kakumei Utena: Itsuka Kakumeisareru Monogatari|少女革命ウテナ いつか革命される物語}}

Developed and published By [[Sega]] for the [[Sega Saturn]] [[video game]] console, the ''Utena'' game was never released outside of Japan.  It tells an original story which is set between episodes 8 and 9 of the TV series. The main character of the game is an original character (no default name, voice: {{Nihongo|[[Kaoru Fujino]]|藤野かほる}}) who transfers to Ohtori Academy.

The game is in the style of a [[visual novel]] with strong [[dating sim]] elements. The major characters each possess a statistic called &quot;Heart's Nobility&quot; which the player affects though dialog choices that appear sporadically during play. Each character's level of Heart's Nobility determines how the game will end.  The special endings available for characters that end with particularly high Heart's Nobility represent the game's dating sim element, but because it is set within the larger plot of the TV series the relationships are usually somewhat platonic, or one-sided affections on the part of the main character.  Yet, there are many aspects of the game that make it interesting to fans, such as duels between Student Council members and the opportunity to turn the main character into a duelist.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Intrusion prevention is the process of performing intrusion detection and attempting to stop detected possible incidents.&lt;ref name=&quot;nist80094&quot; /&gt; Intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS) are primarily focused on identifying possible incidents, logging information about them, attempting to stop them, and reporting them to security administrators.&lt;ref name=&quot;nist80094&quot; /&gt;  In addition, organizations use IDPSs for other purposes, such as identifying problems with security policies, documenting existing threats, and deterring individuals from violating security policies.&lt;ref name=&quot;nist80094&quot; /&gt;  IDPSs have become a necessary addition to the security infrastructure of nearly every organization.&lt;ref name=&quot;nist80094&quot; /&gt;

IDPSs typically record information related to observed events, notify security administrators of important 
observed events, and produce reports.&lt;ref name=&quot;nist80094&quot; /&gt;  Many IDPSs can also respond to a detected threat by attempting to prevent it from succeeding.&lt;ref name=&quot;nist80094&quot; /&gt;  They use several response techniques, which involve the IDPS stopping the attack itself, changing the security environment (e.g., reconfiguring a firewall), or changing the attack’s content.&lt;ref name=&quot;nist80094&quot; /&gt;

== IDS Terminology ==
*'''Alert/Alarm:''' A signal suggesting that a system has been or is being attacked.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitman&quot; /&gt;
*'''True Positive:''' A legitimate attack which triggers an IDS to produce an alarm.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitman&quot; /&gt;
*'''False Positive:''' An event signaling an IDS to produce an alarm when no attack has taken place.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitman&quot; /&gt;
*'''False Negative:''' A failure of an IDS to detect an actual attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitman&quot; /&gt;
*'''True Negative:''' When no attack has taken place and no alarm is raised. 
*'''Noise:''' Data or interference that can trigger a false positive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitman&quot; /&gt; 
*'''Site policy:'''  Guidelines within an organization that control the rules and configurations of an IDS.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitman&quot; /&gt;
*'''Site policy awareness:''' The ability an IDS has to dynamically change its rules and configurations in response to changing environmental activity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitman&quot; /&gt;
*'''Confidence value:''' A value an organization places on an IDS based on past performance and analysis to help determine its ability to effectively identify an attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitman&quot; /&gt;
*'''Alarm filtering:''' The process of categorizing attack alerts produced from an IDS in order to distinguish false positives from actual attacks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitman&quot; /&gt;
*'''Attacker''' or '''Intruder:''' An entity who tries to find a way to gain unauthorized access to information, inflict harm or engage in other malicious activities.
*'''Masquerader:''' A user who does not have the authority to a system, but tries to access the information as an authorized user. They are generally outside users.
*'''Misfeasor:''' They are commonly internal users and can be of two types:
*#An authorized user with limited permissions.
*#A user with full permissions and who misuses their powers.
*'''Clandestine user:''' A user who acts as a supervisor and tries to use his privileges so as to avoid being captured.

=== Types of intrusion detection systems ===
For the purpose of dealing with IT, there are three main types of IDS:

;[[Network intrusion detection system]] (NIDS): It is an independent platform that identifies intrusions by examining network traffic and monitors multiple hosts.  Network intrusion detection systems gain access to network traffic by connecting to a [[network hub]], [[network switch]] configured for [[port mirroring]], or [[network tap]]. In a NIDS, sensors are located at choke points in the network to be monitored, often in the [[demilitarized zone (computing)|demilitarized zone]] (DMZ) or at network borders. Sensors captures all network traffic and analyzes the content of individual packets for malicious traffic. An example of a NIDS is [[Snort (software)|Snort]]. 

;[[Host-based intrusion detection system]] (HIDS): It consists of an agent on a host that identifies intrusions by analyzing system calls, application logs, file-system modifications (binaries, password files, capability databases, [[Access control list]]s, etc.) and other host activities and state. In a HIDS, sensors usually consist of a [[software agent]]. Some application-based IDS are also part of this category. An example of a HIDS is [[OSSEC]].

Intrusion detection systems can also be system-specific using custom tools and [[honeypot (computing)|honeypots]]. In the case of physical building security, IDS is defined as an alarm system designed to detect unauthorized entry.

For the purpose of protecting perimeters of [[Infrastructure security|critical infrastructures]] and high risk assets, there is a primary type of IDS:

;[[Perimeter Intrusion Detection System]] (PIDS):  Detects and pinpoints the location of intrusion attempts on perimeter fences of critical infrastructures. Using either electronics or more advanced [[fibre optic]] cable technology fitted to the perimeter fence, the PIDS detects disturbances on the fence, and this signal is monitored and if an intrusion is detected and deemed by the system as an intrusion attempt, an alarm is triggered.

== Passive and/or reactive systems ==
In a '''passive system''', the intrusion detection system (IDS) sensor detects a potential security breach, logs the information and signals an alert on the console and or owner. In a '''reactive system''', also known as an [[intrusion prevention system]] (IPS), the IPS auto-responds to the suspicious activity by resetting the connection or by reprogramming the firewall to block network traffic from the suspected malicious source. The term [[IDPS]] is commonly used where this can happen automatically or at the command of an operator; systems that both &quot;detect&quot; (alert) and/or &quot;prevent.&quot;

== Comparison with firewalls ==

Though they both relate to network security, an intrusion detection system (IDS) differs from a firewall in that a firewall looks outwardly for intrusions in order to stop them from happening. Firewalls limit access between networks to prevent intrusion and do not signal an attack from inside the network. An IDS evaluates a suspected intrusion once it has taken place and signals an alarm. An IDS also watches for attacks that originate from within a system.  This is traditionally achieved by examining network communications, identifying heuristics and patterns (often known as signatures) of common computer attacks, and taking action to alert operators.  A system that terminates connections is called an [[intrusion prevention system]], and is another form of an [[application layer firewall]].

== Statistical anomaly and signature based IDSes ==
All Intrusion Detection Systems use one of two detection techniques:
;Statistical anomaly-based IDS: A statistical anomaly-based IDS establishes a performance baseline based on normal network traffic evaluations.  It will then sample current network traffic activity to this baseline in order to detect whether or not it is within baseline parameters.  If the sampled traffic is outside baseline parameters, an alarm will be triggered.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitman&quot;&gt;{{cite book

 |year = 2008
 |isbn = 9781423901778
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
;Signature-based IDS: Network traffic is examined for preconfigured and predetermined attack patterns known as signatures.  Many attacks today have distinct signatures.  In good security practice, a collection of these signatures must be constantly updated to mitigate emerging threats.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitman&quot; /&gt;

== Limitations ==
;Noise: Noise can severely limit an Intrusion detection systems effectiveness.  Bad packets generated from software bugs, corrupt DNS data, and local packets that escaped can create a significantly high false-alarm rate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anderson&quot;&gt;{{cite book

 |year = 2001
 |pages = 387–388
 |isbn = 9780471389224
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Too few attacks: It is not uncommon for the number of real attacks to be far below the false-alarm rate. Real attacks are often so far below the false-alarm rate that they are often missed and ignored.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anderson&quot;/&gt;

;Signature updates: Many attacks are geared for specific versions of software that are usually outdated.  A constantly changing library of signatures is needed to mitigate threats. Outdated signature databases can leave the IDS vulnerable to new strategies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anderson&quot;/&gt;

== IDS evasion techniques ==

Intrusion detection system evasion techniques bypass detection by creating different states on the IDS and on the targeted computer. The adversary accomplishes this by manipulating either the attack itself or the network traffic that contains the attack.

== Development ==

A preliminary concept of an IDS began with James P. Anderson and reviews of audit trails.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, James P., &quot;Computer Security Threat Monitoring and Surveillance,&quot; Washing, PA, James P. Anderson Co., 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of an audit trail would be a log of user access.

[[Fred Cohen]] noted in 1984 (see [[Intrusion Detection]]) that it is impossible to detect an intrusion in every case and that the resources needed to detect intrusions grows with the amount of usage.

[[Dorothy E. Denning]], assisted by [[Peter G. Neumann]], published a model of an IDS in 1986 that formed the basis for many systems today.&lt;ref&gt;Denning, Dorothy E., &quot;An Intrusion Detection Model,&quot; Proceedings of the Seventh IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, May 1986, pages 119–131&lt;/ref&gt;  Her model used statistics for [[anomaly detection]], and resulted in an early IDS at [[SRI International]] named the Intrusion Detection Expert System (IDES), which ran on [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] workstations and could consider both user and network level data.&lt;ref&gt;Lunt, Teresa F., &quot;IDES:  An Intelligent System for Detecting Intruders,&quot; Proceedings of the Symposium on Computer Security; Threats, and Countermeasures; Rome, Italy, November 22–23, 1990, pages 110–121.&lt;/ref&gt;  IDES had a dual approach with a rule-based [[Expert System]] to detect known types of intrusions plus a statistical anomaly detection component based on profiles of users, host systems, and target systems.  Lunt proposed adding an [[Artificial neural network]] as a third component.  She said all three components could then report to a resolver.  SRI followed IDES  in 1993 with the Next-generation Intrusion Detection Expert System (NIDES).&lt;ref&gt;Lunt, Teresa F., &quot;Detecting Intruders in Computer Systems,&quot; 1993 Conference on Auditing and Computer Technology, SRI International&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Multics]] intrusion detection and alerting system (MIDAS), an expert system using P-BEST and [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], was developed in 1988 based on the work of Denning and Neumann.&lt;ref&gt;Sebring, Michael M., and Whitehurst, R. Alan., &quot;Expert Systems in Intrusion Detection:  A Case Study,&quot; The 11th National Computer Security Conference, October, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;  Haystack was also developed this year using statistics to reduce audit trails.&lt;ref&gt;Smaha, Stephen E., &quot;Haystack:  An Intrusion Detection System,&quot; The Fourth Aerospace Computer Security Applications Conference, Orlando, FL, December, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

Wisdom &amp; Sense (W&amp;S) was a statistics-based anomaly detector developed in 1989 at the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;Vaccaro, H.S., and Liepins, G.E., &quot;Detection of Anomalous Computer Session Activity,&quot; The 1989 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, May, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;  W&amp;S created rules based on statistical analysis, and then used those rules for anomaly detection.

In 1990, the Time-based Inductive Machine (TIM) did anomaly detection using inductive learning of sequential user patterns in [[Common Lisp]] on a [[VAX]] 3500 computer.&lt;ref&gt;Teng, Henry S., Chen, Kaihu, and Lu, Stephen C-Y, &quot;Adaptive Real-time Anomaly Detection Using Inductively Generated Sequential Patterns,&quot; 1990 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy&lt;/ref&gt;  The Network Security Monitor (NSM) performed masking on access matrices for anomaly detection on a Sun-3/50 workstation.&lt;ref&gt;Heberlein, L. Todd, Dias, Gihan V., Levitt, Karl N., Mukherjee, Biswanath, Wood, Jeff, and Wolber, David, &quot;A Network Security Monitor,&quot; 1990 Symposium on Research in Security and Privacy, Oakland, CA, pages 296–304&lt;/ref&gt;  The Information Security Officer's Assistant (ISOA) was a 1990 prototype that considered a variety of strategies including statistics, a profile checker, and an expert system.&lt;ref&gt;Winkeler, J.R., &quot;A UNIX Prototype for Intrusion and Anomaly Detection in Secure Networks,&quot; The Thirteenth National Computer Security Conference, Washington, DC., pages 115–124, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;  ComputerWatch at [[AT&amp;T Bell Labs]] used statistics and rules for audit data reduction and intrusion detection.&lt;ref&gt;Dowell, Cheri, and Ramstedt, Paul, &quot;The ComputerWatch Data Reduction Tool,&quot; Proceedings of the 13th National Computer Security Conference, Washington, D.C., 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

Then, in 1991, researchers at the [[University of California, Davis]] created a prototype Distributed Intrusion Detection System (DIDS), which was also an expert system.&lt;ref&gt;Snapp, Steven R, Brentano, James, Dias, Gihan V., Goan, Terrance L., Heberlein, L. Todd, Ho, Che-Lin, Levitt, Karl N., Mukherjee, Biswanath, Smaha, Stephen E., Grance, Tim, Teal, Daniel M. and Mansur, Doug, &quot;DIDS (Distributed Intrusion Detection System) -- Motivation, Architecture, and An Early Prototype,&quot; The 14th National Computer Security Conference, October, 1991, pages 167–176.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Network Anomaly Detection and Intrusion Reporter (NADIR), also in 1991, was a prototype IDS developed at the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]'s Integrated Computing Network (ICN), and was heavily influenced by the work of Denning and Lunt.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Kathleen, DuBois, David H., and Stallings, Cathy A., &quot;A Phased Approach to Network Intrusion Detection,&quot; 14th National Computing Security Conference, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;  NADIR used a statistics-based anomaly detector and an expert system.

The [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] announced [[Bro (software)|Bro]] in 1998, which used its own rule language for packet analysis from [[libpcap]] data.&lt;ref&gt;Paxson, Vern, &quot;Bro:  A System for Detecting Network Intruders in Real-Time,&quot; Proceedings of The 7th USENIX Security Symposium, San Antonio, TX, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  Network Flight Recorder (NFR) in 1999 also used libpcap.&lt;ref&gt;Amoroso, Edward, &quot;Intrusion Detection:  An Introduction to Internet Surveillance, Correlation, Trace Back, Traps, and Response,&quot; Intrusion.Net Books, Sparta, New Jersey, 1999, ISBN 0-9666700-7-8&lt;/ref&gt;  APE was developed as a packet sniffer, also using libpcap, in November, 1998, and was renamed [[Snort (software)|Snort]] one month later, and has since become the world's largest used IDS/IPS system with over 300,000 active users.&lt;ref&gt;Kohlenberg, Toby (Ed.), Alder, Raven, Carter, Dr. Everett F. (Skip), Jr., Esler, Joel., Foster, James C., Jonkman Marty, Raffael, and Poor, Mike, &quot;Snort IDS and IPS Toolkit,&quot; Syngress, 2007, ISBN 978-1-59749-099-3&lt;/ref&gt;

The Audit Data Analysis and Mining (ADAM) IDS in 2001 used [[tcpdump]] to build profiles of rules for classifications.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara, Daniel, Couto, Julia, Jajodia, Sushil, Popyack, Leonard, and Wu, Ningning, &quot;ADAM:  Detecting Intrusions by Data Mining,&quot; Proceedings of the IEEE Workshop on Information Assurance and Security, West Point, NY, June 5–6, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Dr. Yongguang Zhang and Dr. Wenke Lee argue for the importance of IDS in networks with mobile nodes.&lt;ref&gt;Intrusion Detection Techniques for Mobile Wireless Networks, ACM WINET 2003 &lt;http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~wenke/papers/winet03.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Oh My Goddess!'''''|ああっ女神さまっ|Ā Megami-sama}}, also known as '''''Ah! My Goddess!''''', is a Japanese ''[[Seinen manga|seinen]]'' [[manga]] series written and illustrated by [[Kōsuke Fujishima]]. It premiered in the November 1988&lt;ref&gt;Oh My Goddess! manga Volume 31 Chapter 196 Page 33, ISBN4-06-321169-X, reprint of original ad&lt;/ref&gt; issue of ''[[Afternoon (magazine)|Afternoon]]'' where it is still being serialized. Every few months, the most recent chapters are published in ''[[tankōbon]]'' volumes by [[Kodansha]] (41 exist as of July 28, 2010).&lt;ref&gt;[http://shop.kodansha.jp/bc/comics/megami/ &quot;講談社BOOK倶楽部：ああっ女神さまっ&quot;]. ''[[Kodansha]]''. Retrieved 2010-07-28.&lt;/ref&gt; The series centers on the relationship between college sophomore [[Keiichi Morisato]] and the goddess [[Belldandy]].

As the manga's popularity increased, a five-episode [[original video animation]] (OVA) was made based on it. With the OVA's success, the stage was set for two TV series and a film to follow.

==Plot==
{{see also|List of Oh My Goddess! characters}}
[[Keiichi Morisato]] is a good-natured, yet hapless and girlfriend-less college freshman who is often imposed upon by his elder dorm-mates and brow-beaten into taking phone messages and doing miscellaneous chores for them. One day, while alone in his dorm, he accidentally calls the Goddess Technical Help Line and a beautiful goddess named [[Belldandy]] materializes in his room. She tells him that her agency has received a system request from him, so she has been sent to grant him a single wish. Skeptical and thinking someone is playing a practical joke on him, he wishes that she stay with him forever. To his surprise, his wish is granted. Belldandy must stay with him, but as his dormitory is strictly male-only, they are both forced onto the street.

They set off on his motorcycle to find alternative shelter, eventually seeking cover in an old [[Buddhist temple]]. In the morning, they are greeted by the temple's sole inhabitant, a young [[Bhikkhu|monk]], who welcomes them and gives them permission to stay until they can find permanent lodging. He immediately puts them to work maintaining the temple grounds, but when he sees Belldandy use her powers to save Keiichi from injury, he begins to fear that she may be a demon or sorceress. He is eventually convinced of Belldandy's intrinsic goodness when he witnesses her solicitous care of the temple premises and her perfect [[meditation]] ritual. When he decides to go on a [[pilgrimage]] to [[India]], the priest gives the couple permission to remain in the temple so long as they continue to maintain it.

===Universe===
The Oh My Goddess! universe is fashioned loosely around [[Norse mythology]]; various names and concepts are recycled for humor.  Three worlds are presented -- Heaven, Hell, and Earth.  It seems apparent that many other worlds also exist.  Heaven is the realm of the Lord and goddesses, Hell is the realm of [[Daimakaicho]] and demons, and Earth is the realm of humans.  Reality is controlled by an enormous and complex computer system, named [[Yggdrasil]].

Each goddess is assigned Class, Category, and Limitations. Class indicates power and skill in performing pure magic.  Only First Class (better) and Second Class (lesser) are cited. First Class goddesses are held to a stricter standard regarding the prohibition to lie.  Three Categories are cited: First, which is Administration, Second, which is Commercial (deals with customers), and Special Duty, which includes the Combat Division.  Limited/Unlimited indicates boundaries on permitted actions.  Goddesses may be penalized, even having their license suspended for a time, for dereliction of duty. A goddess using her powers during suspension will have her license permanently revoked.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Ah! Urd's Small Love Story?.&quot; Ah! My Goddess. Dir. Hiroaki Gōda. TBS, Tokyo, Japan. 23 Dec 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Belldandy]] is a Goddess First Class, Second Category, Unlimited License.  [[Urd]] is a Goddess Second Class, First Category, Limited License.  [[Skuld]] is a Goddess Second Class, First Category, Limited License.

Due to safety concerns regarding their enormous powers, goddesses wear power limiters, usually in the form of jewelry, such as earrings or bracelets.  It is said that a Goddess First Class at full power could easily destroy the Earth, if not careful.  [[Belldandy]]'s power limiter is the second clasp on her left ear.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Ah! The Savior, Together With the Sound of a Flute?.&quot; Ah! My Goddess. Dir. Hiroaki Gōda. TBS, Tokyo, Japan. 24 Jun 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The goddesses' purpose is to bring happiness to everyone around them. Toward that end, heaven has created the Goddess Technical Help Line (also called Goddess Relief Agency), designed to bring happiness to the people of Earth, especially those with great virtue but terrible misfortune. A competing institution, named the Earth Assistance Center, also is staffed by goddesses.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Ah! I Shall Grant Your Wish!.&quot; Ah! My Goddess: Flights of Fancy. Dir. Hiroaki Gōda. TBS, Tokyo, Japan. 18 May 2006. TV.&lt;/ref&gt; In most scenarios, a goddess appears before one that the system has deemed worthy and grants him or her one wish. The wish must be approved by the system, after which a contract is created between the human and the goddess and stored on the [[Yggdrasil]] system as a file. The wish contract file is protected by a passcode known to the Goddess.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Ah! I Wish...Once More!.&quot; Ah! My Goddess: Flights of Fancy. Dir. Hiroaki Gōda. TBS, Tokyo, Japan. 06 Apr. 2006. TV.&lt;/ref&gt; As demons work toward the opposite end, the total happiness on Earth must remain in balance.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Ah! I Want To Fill The World With Happiness!.&quot; Ah! My Goddess: Flights of Fancy. Dir. Hiroaki Gōda. TBS, Tokyo, Japan. 27 Apr 2006. TV.&lt;/ref&gt; Heaven and Hell strictly abide by an agreement to work through contracts and never kill each other.

Demons have similar class and license restrictions, and are accompanied by familiars instead of angels. A seal exists between the demon world and Earth, named the Gate to the Netherworld. It was &quot;created by the gods and can only be broken by an instrument of the gods.&quot; As such, demons require a catalyst to manifest on earth. The demons possess a system similar to [[Yggdrasil]], named [[Nidhogg]]. Both demons and goddesses possess the power to seal beings away. The demons also operate in a fashion similar to goddesses by creating contracts with humans and offering them wishes, but often at a price.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Ah! The Chair of Demonkind Descends!.&quot; Ah! My Goddess: Flights of Fancy. Dir. Hiroaki Gōda. TBS, Tokyo, Japan. 26 July 2006. TV.&lt;/ref&gt;

A goddess does not have an angel automatically, but receives one in egg form.  When her power matures, the egg hatches into an angel, becoming a lifetime companion &lt;ref name=&quot;Goddess 2006&quot;&gt;&quot;Ah! My Darling Cupid!.&quot; Ah! My Goddess: Flights of Fancy. Dir. Hiroaki Gōda. TBS, Tokyo, Japan. 06 July 2006. TV.&lt;/ref&gt;.  The angel always obeys the goddess, being a reflection of the goddess' inner self.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goddess 2006&quot;/&gt;

Other creatures that exist in the Earth plane are a multitude of spirits that are responsible for almost every aspect of life. These include the spirits of Money, Wind, Engine and such. More specific entities include Earth spirits, which are guardians over a specific area of land. [[Morgan le Fay]], a villain from the movie, is probably a high ranking Earth spirit (or a being from another dimension, but that is less likely because her tragic love story with a human must have happened on Earth) who demonstrates great strength fighting [[Belldandy]] and [[Urd]], even though her powers are less potent than the ones of goddesses of their level.

==Production==
Before starting work on ''Oh My Goddess!'', Kōsuke Fujishima created the manga ''[[You're Under Arrest!]]''. [[Miyuki Kobayakawa]], one of the principle characters of ''You're Under Arrest!'', was featured as a goddess character in a [[yonkoma|four-panel]] gag strip in the manga.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ulmer&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Ulmer | first = Jeff | title = Oh My Goddess! #1 (Review) | work = Digitally Obsessed | date = October 5, 2001 | url = http://www.digitallyobsessed.com/showreview.php3?ID=1653 | accessdate = 2008-04-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the exact relationship between this initial goddess character and the ''Oh My Goddess!'' series is unclear, there are suggestions that ''Oh My Goddess!'' can be viewed as a spin-off series.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gubbins&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Gubbins | first = Paul | title = &quot;You're Under Arrest!&quot; TV series FAQ | work = Anime on DVD | accessdate = 2008-03-31 | url = http://www.animeondvd.com/specials/primers/yuaprimer.php }}&lt;/ref&gt; Irrespective of the origin, the concept of a goddess &quot;as a job&quot; interested Fujishima,&lt;ref name=&quot;FujishimaVol4p187&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Fujishima | first = Kōsuke | authorlink = Kōsuke Fujishima | date = February 7, 2007 | chapter = Letters to the Enchantress | title = Oh My Goddess! | volume = 4 | publisher = [[Dark Horse Manga]] | location = Milwaukie, OR | isbn = 1-59307-623-1 | pages = 187 }}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to the first appearance of the ''Oh My Goddess!'' series in the September 1988 issue of the magazine ''[[Afternoon (magazine)|Afternoon]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;McCarthy95&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = McCarthy| first = Helen | authorlink = Helen McCarthy | year = 2006 | title = 500 Manga Heroes and Villains | publisher = Collins &amp; Brown | pages = 95 | isbn = 1843402343 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Title controversy===
Translating the original Japanese title of ああっ女神さまっ (''Aa! Megami-sama!'') proved to be problematic. [[Fred Patten]], in writing the preface to the collection &quot;Watching Anime, Reading Manga: 25 Years of Essays and Reviews&quot;, stated that fans were still debating whether &quot;Ah! My Goddess&quot; or &quot;Oh My Goddess!&quot; should be used at the time of writing, approximately 15 years after the first ''Oh My Goddess!'' manga was published.&lt;ref name=&quot;Patten11&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Patten | first = Fred | authorlink = Fred Patten | year = 2004 | title = Watching Anime, Reading Manga: 25 Years of Essays and Reviews | publisher = Stone Bridge Press, LLC | pages = 11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the United States anime import company [[AnimEigo]] obtained the [[original video animation]] (OVA) rights, they titled the series ''Oh My Goddess!''.&lt;ref name=&quot;AnimEigo&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Oh My Goddess - Anime Products | work = AnimEigo | url = http://www.animeigo.com/Products/ | accessdate = 2008-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach was also followed by [[Toren Smith]] and [[Dark Horse Comics]] when translating the manga. Released in concert with the OVA series in 1994,&lt;ref name=&quot;FujishimaVol2p181&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Fujishima | first = Kōsuke | authorlink = Kōsuke Fujishima | date = April 12, 2006 | chapter = Letters to the Enchantress | title = Oh My Goddess! | volume = 2 | publisher = [[Dark Horse Manga]] | location = Milwaukie, OR | isbn = 1-59307-457-3 | pages = 181 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith has since stated that he saw the title as a play on &quot;Oh my god!&quot;, and felt that there was no problem when translating it. Smith confirmed that his interpretation of the author's intent was correct by consulting with Fujishima.&lt;ref name=&quot;FujishimaVol2p182&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Fujishima | first = Kōsuke | authorlink = Kōsuke Fujishima | date = April 12, 2006 | chapter = Letters to the Enchantress | title = Oh My Goddess! | volume = 2 | publisher = [[Dark Horse Manga]] | location = Milwaukie, OR | isbn = 1-59307-457-3 | pages = 182 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, [[Kodansha]]'s bilingual release of the manga used ''Ah! My Goddess'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Kodansha&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Popular Works: Ah! Megami Sama/Ah! My Goddess! | work = Kodan Club.com | url = http://www.kodanclub.com/cgi-local/comic.cgi?id=009-00002-01-023 | accessdate = 2008-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as did [[Pioneer Corporation|Pioneer]]'s North American release of the film&lt;ref name=&quot;Pioneer&quot;&gt;[http://www.tfaw.com/Brands/Pioneer/Profile/Ah-My-Goddess-The-Movie___46650 Pioneer's Movie title]&lt;/ref&gt;, and [[Media Blasters]]'s 2005 DVD release of the TV series.&lt;ref name=&quot;TBS&quot;&gt;{{ja icon}} [http://www.tbs.co.jp/megamisama/1ki/index-j.html TBS's television anime title]&lt;/ref&gt;

Fujishima stated in [[Animerica]] that &quot;Oh&quot; was closer to his intent, but acknowledged that the title should be rendered so as to make sense within the country that it is published, and specifically stated that films may warrant different titles than other works.&lt;ref name=&quot;FujishimaVol4p188&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Fujishima | first = Kōsuke | authorlink = Kōsuke Fujishima | date = February 7, 2007 | chapter = Letters to the Enchantress | title = Oh My Goddess! | volume = 4 | publisher = [[Dark Horse Manga]] | location = Milwaukie, OR | isbn = 1-59307-623-1 | pages = 188 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He did, however, state that he would prefer to see consistency between the titles of the manga and those of the animations.&lt;ref name=&quot;FujishimaVol4p188&quot; /&gt;

The series revolves around the three goddesses and their rat companion [[List of Oh My Goddess! characters#Gan-chan|Gan-chan]], following their adventures in their temple home. The goddesses remain constantly in miniaturized form, for apparent freedom of space and in order to properly interact with Gan-chan.

{{main|Ah! My Goddess: The Movie}}
A film, titled {{nihongo|''Ah! My Goddess: The Movie''|劇場版ああっ女神さまっ|''Gekijōban Aa! Megami-sama''}}, premiered in Japan in 2000. It saw the return of the main cast, along with several popular characters from the manga who had not appeared in any of the previous anime. It is distributed in Japan by [[Shochiku]] and in North America and United Kingdom by [[Geneon Entertainment]] in 2001. The plot does not seem to follow any of the existing canon, but uses plot devices from several different story arcs from the manga.

The story begins with a flashback to [[Jidaigeki#Sengoku-jidai|Feudal Japan]], when the handsome half-demon [[List of InuYasha characters#InuYasha|InuYasha]] raids a human village to steal the  Sacred Jewel of Four Souls, a magical jewel that enhances its wielder's powers and can grant a single wish. InuYasha hopes to use the gem to turn himself into a demon, but is soon stopped when [[List of InuYasha characters#Kikyo|Kikyo]], the young [[miko]] of the village, shoots him with a sacred arrow, sealing him onto the sacred tree Goshinboku in the nearby forest. Mortally wounded, Kikyo tells her younger sister, [[List of InuYasha characters#Kaede|Kaede]], to burn the jewel with her body to prevent it from falling into the hands of evil.

The story then shifts to modern Tokyo, where a junior high school girl named [[List of InuYasha characters#Kagome Higurashi|Kagome Higurashi]] lives on the grounds of her family's hereditary [[Shinto]] shrine. When she goes into the well house to retrieve her cat, Buyo, a centipede demon bursts out of the enshrined Bone Eater's Well and pulls her through it.

Kagome emerges into a strange wilderness, initially unaware that she has traveled back through time to the [[Sengoku period]] of Japan, fifty years after Kikyo's death. Other than the Bone Eater's Well itself, the only familiar landmark is Goshinboku. She finds InuYasha still sealed onto the tree in an enchanted sleep, and a group of hostile peasants who drag her back to their village.

Their old priestess, Kaede, recognizes Kagome as the reincarnation of her sister Kikyo; when the centipede demon returns, Kaede realizes that the Jewel of Four Souls has also been reborn in Kagome's body. Kagome frees InuYasha so he can kill the centipede demon, but after defeating it, InuYasha again tries to take the Jewel for himself. Kaede thwarts him by placing a magical rosary around his neck, allowing Kagome to subdue him with the simple command, &quot;Sit!&quot;

The Jewel of Four Souls attracts more demons, and the jewel is shattered into numerous shards that disperse across Japan. Even the individual shards are capable of granting great power, and are eagerly sought by humans and demons alike. Kagome and InuYasha set out to collect the shards and restore the Jewel of Four Souls. Along the way, they befriend [[List of InuYasha characters#Shippo|Shippo]], a small fox demon; [[List of InuYasha characters#Miroku|Miroku]], a perverted cursed monk; and [[List of InuYasha characters#Sango|Sango]], a demon-slayer with a tragic past.

The group encounters many friends and foes during the adventure, including InuYasha's older half-brother [[List of InuYasha characters#Sesshomaru|Sesshomaru]]; [[List of InuYasha characters#Kikyo|Kikyo]], partially resurrected with a fragment of Kagome's soul; [[List of InuYasha characters#Naraku|Naraku]], a devious and powerful collective half-demon and the main antagonist who manipulated the initial conflict between Kikyo and InuYasha; and a wolf demon named [[List of InuYasha characters#Koga|Koga]], who is InuYasha's dedicated rival in both love and war.

Eventually, Naraku collects all of the shards and reassembles the Jewel of Four Souls. Although InuYasha defeats him, Naraku uses his power as the Jewel's owner to wish for Kagome's soul to be trapped inside it with his own, which would allow Naraku to survive within it in eternal conflict with her. Naraku's wish can only be fulfilled by tricking Kagome to also make a selfish wish to save herself, but she has enough confidence in InuYasha, and instead wishes for the Jewel to disappear forever.

Kagome is thrown back into her own time, also Inuyasha is thrown back to the feudal world, and the well stopped working. However, after 3 years Kagome graduated high school, and she comes to a realization, which allows the well to work again. This leads Kagome and Inuyasha to meet again and get married.

Written and illustrated by [[Rumiko Takahashi]], ''InuYasha'' premiered in Japan in the November 13, 1996 issue of ''[[Shōnen Sunday]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Inuyasha|journal=[[Shōnen Sunday]]|first=Rumiko|last=Takahashi|issue=50|date=November 13, 1996|issn=1236-2409}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ex&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ex.org/1.x/14-shonen1.html|title=Shonen Sunday, 1996 Issue 50|first=Eri|last=Izawa|month=December|year=1996|accessdate=February 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it ran until its conclusion in the  June 18, 2008 issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-06-10/inuyasha-confirmed-to-end-next-wednesday-in-japan|title=Inuyasha Confirmed to End Next Wednesday in Japan|date=June 10, 2008|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=February 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chapters were published by [[Shogakukan]] in 56 ''[[tankōbon]]'' volumes, with the first volume released in May 1997, and the last released in February 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/409125201X/|title=犬夜叉 1|trans_title=Inuyasha 1|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|language=Japanese|accessdate=February 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4091215807/|title=犬夜叉 56|trans_title=Inuyasha 56|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|language=Japanese|accessdate=February 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Viz Media]] free the series for an English translated release in North America. Initially, Viz released it in monthly American comic book format, each issue containing two or three chapters from the original manga, but eventually abandoned this system in favor of trade paperbacks with the same chapter divisions as the Japanese volumes. Viz released its first trade paperback volume in March 1998. At the time, American manga reprints were normally &quot;flipped&quot; to conform to the American convention of reading books from left to right by [[mirror]]ing the original artwork; among other effects, this caused right-handed characters to appear left-handed. Viz later stopped flipping its new manga releases, although ''InuYasha'' was already well into printing by the time this change was made. Reprints of older volumes have not been &quot;re-flipped&quot; to match the newer ones. As of March 9, 2010, &lt;!-- update? --&gt; 46 volumes were released in North America, and new volumes of the series are being released monthly. Viz has also started to reprint the series in their &quot;VizBig&quot; format, combining three of the original volumes into each omnibus with slightly larger pages and full-color bonus art that was previously reduced to grayscale. 

Viz Media also issues a separate series of &quot;[[ani-manga]]&quot; volumes which are derived from full-color [[screenshots]] of the anime episodes. These volumes are slightly smaller than the regular manga volumes, are oriented in the Japanese tradition of right to left, feature new covers with higher quality pages, and a higher price point versus the regular volumes. Each ani-manga volume is arranged into chapters that correspond to the anime episodes rather than the manga. 

''InuYasha'' is also licensed for regional language releases in [[Argentina]] by [[LARP Editores]], [[Brazil]] by [[Editora JBC]], Italy by [[Star Comics]], France by [[Kana (publisher)|Kana]], Finland, Germany, Norway, and Poland by [[Egmont Publishing|Egmont]], Spain by [[Glénat (publisher)|Glénat]], [[Indonesia]] by [[Elex Media Komputindo]], Mexico by [[Editorial Vid]], [[Israel]] by Aruts Hayeladim, [[Vietnam]] by NXB Trẻ and South Korea by [[Haksan Publishing]].

'''Total depravity''' (also called '''absolute inability''' and '''total corruption''') is a [[theology|theological]] [[doctrine]] that derives from the [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustinian]] concept of [[original sin]]. It is the teaching that, as a consequence of [[the Fall of Man]], every person born into the world is enslaved to the service of [[sin]] and, apart from the [[irresistible grace|efficacious]] or [[prevenient grace|prevenient]] [[divine grace|grace of God]], is utterly unable to choose to follow [[God]] or choose to accept [[salvation]] as it is offered.

It is also advocated to various degrees by many Protestant confessions of faith and catechisms, including those of [[Lutheranism]],&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[Book of Concord]]'', &quot;The Thorough Declaration of the Formula of Concord,&quot; [http://www.bookofconcord.org/fc-sd/originalsin.html chapter II, sections 11 and 12]; The [[Augsburg Confession]], [http://www.reformed.org/documents/augsburg.html Article 2]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arminianism]],&lt;ref&gt;Arminius, James ''The Writings of James Arminius'' (three vols.), tr. James Nichols and W.R. Bagnall (Grand Rapids: Baker, 1956), I:252&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Calvinism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Canons of Dordrecht]], [http://www.reformed.org/documents/canons_of_dordt.html &quot;The Third and Fourth Main Points of Doctrine&quot;]; [[Westminster Confession of Faith]], [http://www.reformed.org/documents/wcf_with_proofs/ch_VI.html chapter 6]; [[Westminster Larger Catechism]], [http://www.reformed.org/documents/wlc_w_proofs/WLC_001-050.html Question 25]; [[Heidelberg Catechism]], [http://www.reformed.org/documents/heidelberg.html question 8]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Summary of the doctrine==
Total depravity is the fallen state of man as a result of original sin. The doctrine of total depravity asserts that people are by nature not inclined or even able to love God wholly with heart, mind, and strength, but rather all are inclined by nature to serve their own will and desires and to reject the rule of God. Even religion and [[philanthropy]] are wicked to God to the extent that these originate from a human imagination, passion, and will and are not done to the glory of God. Therefore, in [[Calvinism|Reformed theology]], if God is to save anyone He must [[Predestination (Calvinism)|predestine]], call, elect individuals to salvation since fallen man does not want to, indeed is incapable of choosing God.&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[Westminster Confession of Faith]]'', [http://www.reformed.org/documents/wcf_with_proofs/ch_IX.html 9.3]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Total depravity does not mean, however, that people are as evil as possible. Rather, it means that even the good which a person may intend is faulty in its premise, false in its motive, and weak in its implementation; and there is no mere refinement of natural capacities that can correct this condition. Thus, even acts of generosity and altruism are in fact [[psychological egoism|egoist]] acts in disguise. All good, consequently, is derived from God alone, and in no way through man. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Ra McLaughlin |journal=Reformed Perspectives |title=Total Depravity, part 1 |url=http://thirdmill.org/newfiles/ra_mclaughlin/TH.McLaughlin.Total_Depravity.1.html |accessdate=2008-07-14 |quote=[Any person] can do outwardly good works, but these works come from a heart that hates God, and therefore fail to meet God’s righteous standards.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This idea can be illustrated by a glass of wine with a few drops of deadly poison in it: Although not all the liquid is poison, all the liquid is ''poisoned''. In the same way, while not all of human nature is depraved, all human nature is totally affected by depravity. 

Nonetheless, the doctrine teaches optimism concerning God's love for what he has made and God's ability to accomplish the ultimate good that he intends for his creation. In particular, in the process of salvation, God overcomes man's inability with his divine grace, though the precise means of this overcoming varies between the theological systems. The differences between the solutions to the problem of total depravity revolve around the relation between divine grace and human [[free will]] &amp;ndash; namely, whether it is [[efficacious grace]] that human free will cannot resist, as in Calvinism, or sufficient or [[prevenient grace]] enabling the human will to choose to follow God, as in [[Molinism]] and [[Arminianism]]. 

===Biblical support for the doctrine===

A number of passages in the [[Christian Bible|Bible]] are used to support the doctrine, including (quotations are from the [[English Standard Version]] except where noted):

* [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 6:5: &quot;The LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.&quot;
* [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 8:21: &quot;And when the LORD smelled the pleasing aroma, the LORD said in his heart, &quot;I will never again curse the ground because of man, for the intention of man’s heart is evil from his youth. Neither will I ever again strike down every living creature as I have done.
* [[Book of Job|Job]]  15:14:  What is man, that he can be pure?   Or he who is born of a woman, that he can be righteous?
15 Behold, God puts no trust in his holy ones,   and the heavens are not pure in his sight;   how much less one who is abominable and corrupt, a man who drinks injustice like water!
* [[Book of Job|Job]]  25:4-6:  How then can man be in the right before God?   How can he who is born of woman be pure? 5 Behold, even the moon is not bright,   and the stars are not pure in his eyes; 6 how much less man, who is a maggot,  and the son of man, who is a worm!&quot;
* [[Psalms]] 51:5: &quot;Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.&quot;
* Psalms 58:3: &quot;The wicked are estranged from the womb; they go astray from birth, speaking lies.&quot;
* [[Ecclesiastes]] 7:20: &quot;Surely there is not a righteous man on earth who does good and never sins.&quot;
* Ecclesiastes 9:3: &quot;This is an evil in all that is done under the sun, that the same event happens to all. Also, the hearts of the children of man are full of evil, and madness is in their hearts while they live, and after that they go to the dead.&quot;
* [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 17:9: &quot;The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately sick; who can understand it?&quot;
* Jeremiah 13:23: ([[New International Version|NIV]]): &quot;Can the Ethiopian change his skin or the leopard its spots? Neither can you do good who are accustomed to doing evil.&quot;
* [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 64:6 &quot;We have all become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous deeds are like a polluted garment. We all fade like a leaf, and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away&quot;
* [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 64:7 &quot;There is no one who calls upon your name, who rouses himself to take hold of you, for you have hidden your face from us and have made us melt in the hand of our iniquities.&quot;
* [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 64:8 &quot;But now, O LORD, you are our Father; we are the clay, and you are our potter; we are all the work of your hand.&quot;
* [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 7:21-23: &quot;For from within, out of the heart of man, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, coveting, wickedness, deceit, sensuality, envy, slander, pride, foolishness. All these evil things come from within, and they defile a person.&quot;
* [[Gospel of John|John]] 3:19: &quot;And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their deeds were evil.&quot;
* John 6:44: &quot;[Jesus said,] 'No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him. And I will raise him up on the last day.'&quot; 
* John 6:64-65: &quot;[Jesus said,] 'But there are some of you who do not believe.' (For Jesus knew from the beginning who those were who did not believe, and who it was who would betray him.) And he said, 'This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted him by the Father.'&quot;
* John 8:34: &quot;Jesus answered them, 'Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who commits sin is a slave to sin.'&quot;
* [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 3:10-11: &quot;None is righteous, no, not one; no one understands; no one seeks for God.&quot;
* Romans 8:7-8: &quot;For the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God, for it does not submit to God's law; indeed, it cannot. Those who are in the flesh cannot please God.&quot;
* [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1 Corinthians]] 2:14: &quot;The natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are folly to him, and he is not able to understand them because they are spiritually discerned.&quot;
* [[Epistle to the Ephesians|Ephesians]] 2:1-3: &quot;And you were dead in the trespasses and sins in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience - among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind.&quot; (our depravity being emphasised in the concept of being &quot;dead&quot;; only something external -i.e. God- can give a dead man life)
* [[Epistle to Titus|Titus]] 3:3: &quot;For we ourselves were once foolish, disobedient, led astray, slaves to various passions and pleasures, passing our days in malice and envy, hated by others and hating one another.&quot;

==Origins of the doctrine in the Late Antique Church==

Many of the early Church Fathers affirmed the freedom of the will in man, laying the responsibility for whether any particular person followed virtue or vice on them, while also maintaining the need for grace from God in salvation&lt;ref&gt;God's Strategy in Human History
Roger Forster (Author), Paul Marston (Author), Wipf &amp; Stock Publishers (July 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;.
Writing against the [[monk]] [[Pelagius]], whom he understood as teaching that man's nature was unaffected by the Fall, or at least was only weakened in the Fall, and that he was free to follow after God apart from divine intervention, Augustine developed the doctrine of [[original sin]] and, Calvinists contend, the doctrine of total inability. Augustine's views prevailed in the controversy, and Pelagius' teaching was condemned as heretical at the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] (431) and again condemned in the moderated form known as [[semi-Pelagianism]] at the second [[Councils of Orange|Council of Orange]] (529). Augustine's idea of &quot;original&quot; (or inherited) guilt was not shared by all of his contemporaries in the [[Greek language|Greek]]-speaking part of the church and is still not shared in [[Eastern Orthodoxy]].

==Objections to Total Depravity==

The [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]] maintains that man cannot &quot;be justified before God by his own works,.. without the grace of God through Jesus Christ,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.hanover.edu/texts/trent/ct06.html Council of Trent, Session 6, canon 1].&lt;/ref&gt; thereby rejecting [[Pelagianism]] in accordance with the writings of Augustine and the [[Council_of_Orange#Second_Council_of_Orange|Second Council of Orange]] (529).&lt;ref&gt;[http://reformed.org/documents/canons_of_orange.html Judgements of the Council of Orange]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Catholic Church disagrees with the [[Protestant]] doctrine of total depravity, because the Catholic Church maintains man retained a free but wounded will after the Fall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p1s2c1p7.htm Catechism of the Catholic Church] Item 407 in section 1.2.1.7.&lt;/ref&gt;  Referring to Scripture and the Church Fathers&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P5M.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church] Item 1730&lt;/ref&gt;, Catholicism views man's free will as deriving from being made in God's image.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P5G.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church] Items 1701-1709&lt;/ref&gt;  Accordingly, the Catholic Church condemned as heresy any doctrine asserting &quot;since Adam's sin, the free will of man is lost and extinguished&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.hanover.edu/texts/trent/ct06.html Council of Trent, Session 6, canon 5].&lt;/ref&gt;.  

There are some [[Protestant]] groups that disagree with the doctrine of total depravity.  Some modern day Protestants (for instance, followers of [[Charles Finney]]) align themselves more with Pelagius than with Augustine regarding man's fallen nature.{{Fact|date=October 2008}}

The doctrine of total depravity was decried by the [[Five articles of Remonstrance]] and by [[Jacobus Arminius]] himself, and John Wesley, who strongly identified with Arminius through publication of his periodical ''The Arminian'', also advocated a strong doctrine of inability.&lt;ref&gt;Sermon 44, [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/wesley/sermons.v.xliv.html#v.xliv-p0.2 &quot;Original Sin.&quot;]; compare verse 4 of [[Charles Wesley]]'s [[hymn]] [http://gbgm-umc.org/umhistory/wesley/hymns/umh363.stm &quot;And Can It Be&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;[[Arminianism]]&quot; has mistakenly also come to include some who hold the [[Semipelagianism|Semipelagian]] doctrine of [[limited depravity]], which allows for an &quot;island of righteousness&quot; in human hearts that is uncorrupted by sin and able to accept God's offer of salvation without a special dispensation of grace.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} Although Arminius and Wesley both vehemently rejected this view, it has sometimes inaccurately been lumped together with theirs (particularly by Calvinists) because of other similarities in their respective systems such as [[conditional election]], [[unlimited atonement]], and prevenient grace. In particular, prevenient grace is seen in many of these systems as giving humans back the freedom to follow God in one way or another.

One self-evident refutation of the doctrine is that it implicitly rejects either God's love or omnipotence. That is, it is argued that if God is both loving and omnipotent, then God would not have allowed mankind to become totally corrupt. Thus, total depravity would imply God is either not all-loving or not omnipotent. 

Advocates of total depravity offer a variety of responses to this line of argumentation. Wesleyans suggest that God endowed man with the free will that allowed humanity to become depraved and he also provided a means of escape from the depravity. Calvinists note that the argument assumes that either God's love is necessarily incompatible with corruption or that God is constrained to follow the path that some men see as best, whereas they believe God's plans are not fully known to man and God's reasons are his own and not for man to question (compare [[Book of Romans|Rom.]] [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom+9:18-24 9:18-24]; [[Book of Job|Job]] [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=job+38:1-42:6 38:1-42:6]). Some particularly dislike the Calvinist response because it leaves the matter of God's motives and means largely unresolved, but the Calvinist sees it merely as following [[John Calvin|Calvin]]'s famous dictum that &quot;whenever the Lord shuts his sacred mouth, [the student of the Bible] also desists from inquiry.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Institutes of the Christian Religion]]'' [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/institutes.iv.iii.xxii.html?bcb=0 3.21.3]

'''Skåne County''' (''Skåne län'') is the southernmost administrative [[Counties of Sweden|county]] or ''[[län]]'', of [[Sweden]], basically corresponding to the historical [[Provinces of Sweden|province]] [[Scania]]. It borders the counties of [[Halland County|Halland]], [[Kronoberg County|Kronoberg]] and [[Blekinge County|Blekinge]]. The seat of residence for the [[List of Skåne Governors|Skåne Governor]] is the town of [[Malmö]]. The headquarters of [[Region Skåne]] is the town of [[Kristianstad]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skane.se/templates/Page.aspx?id=54724 About Region Skåne]. Region Skåne. Retrieved 10 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The present county was created in 1997 when [[Kristianstad County]] and [[Malmöhus County]] were merged.

Skåne County covers around 3% of Sweden's total area, but its population of 1,200,000 comprises 13% of Sweden's total population.

== Heraldry ==
The coat of arms for Skåne County is the same as for the province of Scania only with the [[tincture (heraldry)|tinctures]] reversed and the crown, beak and tongue of the [[Griffin]] in the same color. When the arms is shown with a royal crown it represents the County Administrative Board, which is the regional presence of (royal) government authority. Blazon: &quot;Gules, a Griffin's head erased Or, crowned and armed the same&quot;.

== Provinces ==
Skåne County is the administrative equivalent of the [[province]] of [[Scania]], but it also includes an insignificant part of the province [[Halland]].

== Administration ==
The seat of residence for the [[List of County Governors of Sweden|Governor]] or ''Landshövding'' is the town of [[Malmö]]. The County Administrative Board is a [[Government Agencies in Sweden|Government Agency]] headed by a Governor. See [[List of Skåne Governors]].

The two former administrative counties of the province of Scania shown on the map, [[Kristianstad County]] and [[Malmöhus County]], which were established in 1719 were merged together in 1997, forming the present county with boundaries that are almost identical to the boundaries of the province.

== County council ==
'''[[Skåne Regional Council]]''' (''Region Skåne'') is an evolved [[County Councils of Sweden|County Council]], which was established in 1999 when the County Councils of the former counties were amalgamated. Its main responsibilities are for the public healthcare system and public transport. In addition, it has for a trial period assumed certain tasks from the County Administrative Board.  

Its county or regional assembly is the highest political body in the region and its members are elected by the electorate,&lt;ref name=&quot;RS2&quot;&gt;Region Skåne. [http://www.skane.se/templates/Page.aspx?id=43835 Democracy-Increased autonomy]. Official site. Retrieved 24 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to the [[County Administrative Boards of Sweden|county administrative board]], that guards the national interests in the county under the chairmanship of the [[List of County Governors of Sweden|county governor]] (''landshövding'' in Swedish).

== Municipalities ==
[[Image:Skåne County.png|miniatyr|left|350px|Skånes kommuner.]]
Skåne County is subdivided into 33 [[municipalities of Sweden|municipalities]]&lt;ref&gt;Region Skåne.[http://www.skane.se/templates/Page.aspx?id=56606 Municipalities in Skåne]. Official site. Retrieved 24 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
(''kommuner'' in Swedish), the largest being [[Malmö Municipality]] (280,000 inhabitants), [[Helsingborg Municipality]] (124,000), [[Lund Municipality]] (103,000 inhabitants) and [[Kristianstad Municipality]] (75,000 inhabitants). The municipalities have municipal governments, similar to [[city commission government|city commissions]], and are further divided into parishes. The parish division is traditionally used by the [[Church of Sweden]], but also serves as a divisioning measure for Swedish census and elections.

== Transport ==
{{see also|Skåne commuter rail}}
The [[motorway]] built between Malmö and Lund in 1953 was the first [[List of motorways in Sweden|motorway in Sweden]]. With the opening of the [[Oresund Bridge]] between [[Malmö]] and [[Copenhagen]] (the longest combined road and rail bridge in Europe) in 2000, the Swedish motorways were linked with [[European route E20]] in Denmark, and the two countries' railway systems were physically connected. Before the bridge was built there were [[train ferry|train ferries]] operated between Helsingborg and Helsingør. There are also train ferries to and from [[Germany]] and [[Poland]].

Scania has three major public airports, [[Malmö Airport]], [[Ängelholm-Helsingborg Airport]] and [[Kristianstad Airport]]. One of the oldest airports in the world still in use is located in Scania, namely [[Ljungbyhed Airport]], in operation since 1910. Starting in 1926, the 
[[Swedish Air Force]] used the airport for flight training, and up until the military school was moved to the nearby Ängelholm F10 Wing in 1997, 
the airport was extremely busy. In the late 1980s, it was Sweden's busiest airport, with a record high of more than 1,400 take-offs and landings per day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20050907012811/http://www.tfhs.lu.se/english/skolan/6.html Ljungbyhed airport - ESTL]. Fact sheet created by [http://www.lusa.lu.se Lund University School of Aviation]. Retrieved 22 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The major ports of Scania are [[Copenhagen Malmö Port]] and [[Helsingborg]] Harbour. Ferry connections across the [[Baltic Sea]] operate from several smaller ports as well.

In [[music]], a '''whole tone scale''' is a [[scale (music)|scale]] in which each [[note]] is separated from its neighbours by the [[interval (music)|interval]] of a [[whole step]]. There are only two [[complementary]] whole tone scales, both six-note or ''[[Hexatonic scale|hexatonic]]'' scales:
[[Image:Whole tone scale on C.png|525px|thumb|center|the whole tone scale on C {{audio|Whole tone scale on C.ogg|Play}}: {C, D, E, F{{music|sharp}}, G{{music|sharp}}, A{{music|sharp}}, C}, and]]
[[Image:Whole tone scale on B.PNG|525px|thumb|center|the whole tone scale on B {{audio|Whole tone scale on B.mid|Play}}:{B, D{{music|flat}}, E{{music|flat}}, F, G, A, B}.]]

[[Image:Augmented triad on C.png|thumb|right|Augmented triad on C {{audio|Augmented triad on C.mid|Play}}.]]
[[Image:Augmented triad on D.png|thumb|right|Augmented triad on D {{audio|Augmented triad on D.mid|Play}}.]]
The whole tone scale has no [[leading tone]] and because all tones are the same distance apart, &quot;no single tone stands out, [and] the scale creates a blurred, indistinct effect&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Kamien, Roger (2008). ''Music: An Appreciation'', Sixth Brief Edition, p.308. ISBN 978-0-07-340134-8.&lt;/ref&gt; This effect is especially emphasized by the fact that [[triad (music)|triads]] built on such scale tones are [[Augmented triad|augmented]].  Indeed, one can play all six tones of a whole tone scale simply with two augmented triads whose roots are a major second apart.  Since they are [[symmetric scale|symmetrical]], whole tone scales do not give a strong impression of the [[tonic (music)|tonic]] or [[tonality]].

The composer [[Olivier Messiaen]] called the whole tone scale his first [[modes of limited transposition|mode of limited transposition]]. The composer and music theorist [[George Perle]] calls the whole tone scale [[interval cycle]] 2, or C2. Since there are only two possible whole tone scale positions (that is, the whole tone scale can be transposed only once), it is either C2&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; or C2&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. For this reason, the whole tone scale is also [[Maximal evenness|maximally even]] and may be considered a [[generated collection]].

Due to this symmetry the [[hexachord]] consisting of the whole-tone scale is not distinct under inversion or more than one transposition. Thus many composers have used one of the '''&quot;almost whole-tone&quot; hexachords''' whose, &quot;individual structural differences can been seen to result only from a difference in the 'location,' or placement, of a semitone within the otherwise whole-tone series.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Schmalfeldt, Janet (1983). ''Berg's Wozzeck: Harmonic Language and Dramatic Design'', p.48. ISBN 0-300-02710-9.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander Scriabin]]'s [[Mystic chord]] is a primary example, being a whole tone scale with one note raised a semitone, with this alteration allowing for a greater variety of resources through transposition.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Evolution of Twelve-Note Music&quot;, p.56. Oliver Neighbour. ''Proceedings of the Royal Musical Association'', 81st Sess. (1954 - 1955), pp. 49-61.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical music==
Use of the melodic whole tone scale can be traced at least as far back as [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], in his ''[[A Musical Joke|Musical Joke]]'', for strings and horns.  In the 19th century Russian composers went further with melodic and harmonic possibilities of the scale, often to depict the ominous; consider the endings of the [[overture]]s to [[Mikhail Glinka|Glinka's]] opera ''[[Ruslan and Lyudmila (opera)|Ruslan and Lyudmila]]'' and [[Alexander Borodin|Borodin's]] ''[[Prince Igor]]'', the Commander's theme in [[Alexander Dargomyzhsky|Dargomyzhsky]]'s ''[[The Stone Guest (Dargomyzhsky)|The Stone Guest]]'', and the sea king's music in [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]]'s ''[[Sadko_(opera)|Sadko]]''. (For some short piano pieces written completely in whole-tone scale, see nos. 1, 6, and 7 from [[Vladimir Rebikov|V.A. Rebikov's]] [http://imslp.org/wiki/Une_f%C3%AAte%2C_Op.38_(Rebikov%2C_Vladimir_Ivanovich) ''Празднество'' (''Une fête''), Op. 38], from 1907.)

H.C. Colles names as the &quot;childhood of the whole-tone scale&quot; the music of [[Berlioz]] and [[Schubert]] in France and then Russians [[Glinka]] and [[Dargomijsky]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Childhood of the Whole-Tone Scale&quot;, p.17-19. H. C. Colles. ''The Musical Times'', Vol. 55, No. 851. (Jan. 1, 1914), pp. 16-20. ''The Musical Times'' is currently published by Musical Times Publications Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Claude Debussy]], who had been influenced by Russians, along with other [[Impressionist music|Impressionist]] [[composer]]s made extensive use of whole tone scales.  The whole tone scale was also used by [[Alban Berg]] in his ''[[Violin Concerto (Berg)|Violin Concerto]]'' (the last four notes of the [[tone row|12-tone row]] he used are B, C{{music|#}}, E{{music|b}} and F, which, together with the first note, G, comprise 5 of the 6 notes of the scale) and by [[Béla Bartók]] in his ''[[String Quartet No. 5 (Bartók)|Fifth String Quartet]]''. [[Ferruccio Busoni]] used the whole tone scale in the right hand part of the &quot;Preludietto, Fughetta ed Esercizio&quot; of his ''[[An die Jugend]]'', and [[Franz Liszt]] applied the whole tone scale to parts of the score of his ''[[Dante Symphony]]''.

==Jazz harmony==
The scale is also used extensively in modern [[jazz]] writing and [[jazz harmony]]. [[Wayne Shorter]]'s composition &quot;[[JuJu (Wayne Shorter album)|JuJu]]&quot; features heavy use of the whole tone scale, and [[John Coltrane]]'s ''One Down, One Up'' is built off two augmented chords arranged in the same simple structure as his earlier tune ''[[Impressions (instrumental)|Impressions]]''. However, these are only the most overt examples of the use of this scale in jazz. A vast number of jazz tunes, including many standards, use augmented chords and their corresponding scales as well, usually to create tension in [[turnaround (music)|turnaround]]s or as a substitute for a dominant seventh chord. [[Art Tatum]] and [[Thelonious Monk]] are two pianists who used the whole tone scale extensively and creatively.

A prominent example of the whole tone scale that made its way into pop music are bars 3 and 4 of the opening of [[Stevie Wonder]]'s song &quot;[[You Are the Sunshine of My Life]]&quot;{{fact|date=June 2010}}.

==Non-western music==
The [[rāga]] ''[[Sahera]]'' in [[Hindustani classical music]] uses the same intervals as the whole tone scale. [[Ustad]] [[Mehdi Hassan]] has performed this rāga.

==As pertaining to Pythagoras==
Pythagoras' theory that all the planets had &quot;tones&quot; between them.  From the sphere of the earth to the sphere of the moon; one tone; from the sphere of the moon to that of Mercury, one half-tone; from Mercury to Venus, one-half; from Venus to the sun, one and one-half tones; from the sun to Mars, one tone; from Mars to Jupiter, one-half tone; from Jupiter to Saturn, one-half tone; from Saturn to the fixed stars, one-half tone. The sum of these intervals equals the six whole tones of the octave. [http://www.sacred-texts.com/eso/sta/sta19.htm]. Based on some views, this may have been just because Pythagoras wanted it to.

==Songs==
===&quot;Maggot Brain&quot;===
:''See main article at [[Maggot Brain (song)]]''

===&quot;Can You Get to That&quot;===
This song is a departure from the groove-oriented Funkadelic sound and is more of a traditional lyric-based acoustic rock piece.  It begins with a descending acoustic guitar line which is joined by piano, bass and drums which support a cast of singers. It is a rewrite of a song by [[The Parliaments]] titled, &quot;What You Been Growin'&quot; and is heavily influenced by [[gospel music]] stylistically.

Where the Parliaments version was a break-up song, the singer of the Funkadelic version begins with the line 'I once had a life, or rather, life had me' (a possible reference to [[The Beatles]]' &quot;[[Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)]]&quot;, which begins with the lines, &quot;I once had a girl, or should I say, she once had me?&quot;): rather than a bitter reminiscence about a woman, it becomes an account of the singer's revelation that living on principles of co-operation, sincerity and the principles of [[karma]] ('When you base your life on credit and your loving days are done / Checks you sign with love and kisses later come back signed 'Insufficient Funds' ' - interestingly, this line seems to echo part of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]'s '[[I Have a Dream]]' speech) mark him out from the un-enlightened crowd and exalted his life.

*Drums: [[Fuzzy Haskins]]

===&quot;Hit It and Quit It&quot;===
The song feature Bernie Worrell's vocals and organ-playing, as well as an extended [[Eddie Hazel]] solo at the end.
*Lead Vocals: [[Bernie Worrell]]

===&quot;You and Your Folks, Me and My Folks&quot;===
Some claim that this song is, lyrically and musically, a sequel to &quot;Hit It And Quit It&quot; (the previous song). It is a very class-conscious song, with the singer pleading for unity among the poor because without doing so, equality could not be achieved.

The song's refrain is very similar to an old folk rhyme that was first published in Thomas W. Talley's ''Negro Folk Rhymes (Wise or Otherwise)'' (1922):{{Quote box

*Lead Vocals: [[Billy Bass Nelson]]

===&quot;Super Stupid&quot;===
The title of this song refers to a drug addict who buys the wrong drug accidentally. He is also referred to as having a &quot;maggot brain&quot;. The verse of the song uses similar combination of rap singing over drum rhythm plus occasional guitar chords as is heard on &quot;Crosstown Traffic&quot; by [[Jimi Hendrix]]. 

The [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[Audioslave]] has done several live [[Cover version|covers]] of this song, as well as an unreleased studio recording. The song was also covered by [[Tackhead]] on their album ''Strange Things''.

* Lead Vocals: [[Eddie Hazel]]

=== &quot;Back in Our Minds&quot; ===
This song seems to be about the singer and someone else (possibly different races, former lovers or friends) having reconciled and are now &quot;brothers.&quot;
* Lead Vocals: [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]], [[Tawl Ross]]
* Trombone: McKinley Jackson
* Bongos: [[Eddie &quot;Bongo&quot; Brown]]
* Jew's Harp: [[James W. Jackson]]

=== &quot;Wars of Armageddon&quot; ===
The music is a bizarre mix of music and special effects-type sounds, and intelligent, though unusual and abstract, lyrics.

This song is socially conscious, as the singer demands immediate freedom from oppression, as well as &quot;power to the people&quot; (and many more demands, many nonsensical, see above).

=== Whole Lot of BS ===
This song is a bonus track on the album, originally released as a non-album [[B-side]] to the single &quot;Hit It and Quit It&quot;.

===I Miss My Baby===
This song is another bonus track, originally released as the B-side to an early take of &quot;Baby I Owe You Something Good&quot;, which was later reworked for the ''[[Let's Take It to the Stage]]'' LP. The single was credited to ''US Music with Funkadelic'', as [[Garry Shider]]'s group US was featured on the recording with Funkadelic playing most of the music.

'''Luc Ferrari''', French composer born on February 5, 1929 in [[Paris]] - deceased on August 22, 2005 in [[Arezzo]] in [[Italy]].

==Biography==

Luc Ferrari trained in music since a very young age and continued his composition and piano studies, until a case of tuberculosis in his youth interrupted his career as a pianist. From then on he mostly concentrated on musical composition. During this illness he had the opportunity to become acquainted with the radio receiver, with pioneers such as [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schönberg]], [[Alban Berg|Berg]], [[Anton Webern|Webern]] and others who strengthened him in his resolution to dissociate himself from the instruction of his first conservatoires{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}.

He participated from 1954 to 1958 in the “Internationale Ferienkurse Darmstadt” - international vacation courses, where he had friendly relations with [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], [[Luigi Nono]], [[Luciano Berio]], [[Henri Pousseur]], [[John Cage]], [[Edgard Varèse]].  Later and afterwards [[Pierre Schaeffer]] still increased his urge to break the dams which force the musical traditions until then. Ferrari could only withdraw himself from dogmas.

Overwhelmed by «Déserts» from [[Edgard Varèse]], he likewise discovered at the broadcast, he decided immediately in the year 1954 to visit him in New York. He dedicated this trip of several weeks on a freighter to the composition of piano pieces.
His attraction to the musique concrète and his collaboration with [[Pierre Schaeffer]] from 1957 to 1966 led him to extend the notion of abstract music, to want to tear the membrane between the genres{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}. The first portable tape recorders allowed him to collect outside of the studios the sound for his piece ''Hétérozygote'', his first composition that he calls - with a smile, -  ''« anecdotic music »'' - : ''«I want that the gesture of taking sounds outside allows my admission to the social. »''{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}
There is no doubt that this composition from 1963-64 revealed his mind of freedom{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}. 
From then on, his activities proved this as well as his deep attention to the society, his character open in all directions, marking his work within the most different areas such as films; writings; installations; symphonic works or for ensembles; works, in which he connected instruments with recorded sounds; spectacle-concert; multimedia; electroacoustic works; radio plays and also, starting from 1999, his work with experimental DJs and improvisation.
Besides his inclination to the society, to the mixture of genres, his sense of humor, sensuality narration, perversion, to the anecdotic, Ferrari’s compositions transmit his revolt, his desire and his love for life{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}.

With the films of 1965-66 for the [[Service de la Recherche of the O.R.T.F]] ''Les Grandes Répétitions'' - the important rehearsals - (INA), which he realizes with [[Gérard Patris]], and which opened the spirit of the composers and pioneers such as [[Messiaen]], [[Stockhausen]], [[Varèse]], [[Hermann Scherchen]], [[Cecil Taylor]], it happened for the first time that contemporary music was presented on French television. These are unique documents coveted by a large world of music{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}.

== The Concepts ==

Another turn in his music was for Ferrari: Presque Rien ou le lever du Jour au Bord de la Mer - almost nothing or daybreak at the sea -. This piece illustrates or rather suggests unconsciously a [[minimalist]] process, about which one will speak much in the following years.

=== Concept of the Unit ===
Indeed, ''Presque Rien ou le lever du Jour au Bord de la Mer'', from between 1967 and 1970, is a composition which materializes the break with the practices of the classical electro acoustics. Still more directly than what was called after ''Hétérozygote'', anecdotic music, he requires for himself clearly the continuous sequence and the fixed sound image - like a slide - offering a slice of real as a work method and as means to escape from the habits.
&quot;'' « At the beginning the concept ''Presque Rien'' does not have anything to do with the music. One must carry oneself back into the time; in the sixties one said: noises on a side, music on the other one. » ''&quot; Ferrari did not get involved in this play.
He was concerned with making something coming from a deep desire without worrying whether this something fits into a category.
The concept in his opinion cannot be defined as genre, as aesthetics or as technology, but only as ''idea''. That means that the concept at the beginning cannot be seized physically, but rather as a general impression, which one lends to a body.
This concept consists of:  only one place - only one time - a certain acoustics - components, which he continues to develop from one ''Presque Rien'' to the other.

=== Concept of narration (''Presque Rien No. 2 - ainsi continue la Nuit dans ma Tête multiple'') - and the night continues in my numerous head - ===
One of the main characteristics of the ''Presque Rien'' is the narration,
Not in the sense to tell a story, rather to make observable the time suggesting that something occurs in a place.
Against the sound landscapes, where the place is perceptible, the elements he uses, and which he calls everyday life sounds should, by the concept of a minimal and not eventful story stimulate to a journey in the time; the coincidence of the everyday life noises belonging to the daily gestures and consisting of substance, is the element that constructs the time. The intention to tell is there, but remains blurred.

=== Concept of the Lie or the Perversion (''Presque Rien avec filles'') - almost nothing with girls ===
The concept of the lie stimulates Ferrari, and to name it, is almost a provocation. He uses the term of the perversion precisely in this sense.
A concept is relatively abstract, however it becomes alive with the change of time. This is exactly, what he calls Perversion. But since it’s his invention, he has no reason to remain loyal to his concept. If loyalty should be, so only that of the search for certain acoustics.

=== Concept of the Beauty (''Presque Rien No. 4'') ===
Ferrari believed for a long time, and the time helping, that beauty was a concept of the past, like a somewhat mallow and superfluous attribute. He believes from now on in the contrary that we should be concerned with the beauty, that it is indispensable for our reflection.
Or don't we have the time any more to be in charge of beauty because hideousness exasperates us?
He lived since some years in a suburb, where everything is ugly, inharmonious and wrong on its place, thus the harmony and the beauty appear to him as a necessity and not at all a trifle or a secondary matter.

=== Concept of the Disappearance (''Presque Rien No. 5, - almost nothing with instruments -'') ===
Indeed, the ''Presque Rien'' are in search of the beauty of the sound, the harmony of the sound.
In the search for the harmony of relations and the times.
Disappears the narration.
Disappears the recording as memory of a place or a situation.
Remains a kind of report, the presentation of some fewer elements, like a dilution and, how these find their place in the time.
The matter In ''Presque Rien No. 5'' is the play of the objets musicaux - musical objects -.

=== ''Exploitation of the Concepts'' ===

« Since autumn 99, I have undertaken the composition of a new series of pieces with the general title ''Exploitation of the concepts''. My purpose is to use those concepts I experimented in the course of my life as a composer and to use them in all possible directions. »

*'''Archives sauvées des Eaux''' (2000)
''Exploitation of the concepts 1'' - archives saved from the flood - 
(for 2 CD and Vinyls - 48 ') 
&quot;''The thought to use my archives resulted from the necessity, to update my tapes of these memories - which suffered in my studio a damage caused by water -. I have indeed analogue tapes with all recordings I made since 1960, and which I have used or not. While copying this material on CD I felt the need to convert this boring work into creative work. And instead of copying I began to compose with them. ''&quot;

*'''Cycle des souvenirs''' (1995–2000) - cycle of the memories -
''Exploitation of the concept 2'' (installation with 6 CD and 4 video projectors) - (duration: endless) 
&quot;''To use the memories is not new to me, who are always backdue regarding the autobiographies.What is different here is to manage together as well the sound as the picture. In the same way as I am a sound taker-composer, I am a here a picture taker-composer.
Also the cycle of the memories means that all components are structured in cycles, which produce random encounters by their overlay. Therefore everything is rotating. &quot;''

*'''Archives Génétiquement Modifiées'''  (2000)
''Exploitation of the concepts 3'' - Genetically Modified Archives (memorized sounds) -  (25')
&quot;''While listening to my recordings from the seventies I suddenly felt the need, without nostalgia and without allegiance on the past, to make new from it. Also I took very large freedom and easiness concerning the concepts while exploiting them. Indeed, if I speak of it, the question is not to make recognizable the concept, as that was usual at that time, rather to recover this idea thirty years later, how it rubs against the other earlier experiences, how it deforms or takes differently form. Or disappears. Perhaps I like also to use the word „exploitation“ in a provocative sense - although a little frivolously - as a concept. Also I claim the right to use my ideas exactly the same way as my sounds. I listen and I make from it a present that is rich of memory.Thus these archives are fundamentally and even perhaps genetically modified.&quot;''

*'''Tautologies et Environs'''  (2000–2001) - Tautologies and environments - 
''Exploitation of the Concepts 4''
For 14 sound-amplified instruments and memorized sound (25 ')
''The ''Exploitation of concept 1. 3 and 4'' use the same elements for the memorized material, but differently assembled and deeply changed. Here the composition for orchestra, using the ideas of the tautology, gives a completely new aspect to the memorized sound. Also one encounters as new the idea of the tautology used in the composition for orchestra, particularly if one refers to the earlier ''Tautologos''.&quot;''

*'''Exploitation of the concept of the Autobiography'''

&quot;''Since the beginning I composed as many works for instruments or orchestra as electroacoustic or acousmatic pieces. In other words and, in order to approach more precisely my topic, I would speak here only of the electroacoustic pieces or those developed with technology. First unconsciously, then more and more aware came up to me that I worked on the field of the autobiography. Thus I can only retrospectively speak about the time that led me to this concept. This happened about 1962, while I worked on the project of an electroacoustic piece: ''Hétérozygote''. I thus want to try to explain, how significant the simple gesture was to go out from the studio searching sounds outside. I went out with portable utensils, which were my property, i.e. with my microphones and my tape recorder. This was my equipment, and it was I.Whether one wants or not, I was here in an original situation of presence and instrumental recognition making of me without being conscious, a manufacturer of the autobiography. I was present, I held my microphone, I put on my tape recorder as soon as I considered it was good, I took the sound that occurred front of me at the time I decided. This sound was my choice, my moment of the life stored on my equipment.
In other words, should the last sentence not be clear, this compositional gesture in the recognition of the even indistinct sound, recognizing the found object as the first condition of an emotional attitude, was the inevitable introduction of the composer’s present in real time and thus as an autobiographer. &quot;''
In this sense were realized the radio compositions for the German broadcasts [[Südwestfunk]] and [[Hessischer Rundfunk]],

Luc Ferrari wanted to remain young, not age. The life of this thus young 76 years old man expired in Arezzo on 22 August 2005.

The center also contains the Huntsville Operations Support Center (HOSC), a facility that supports Space Shuttle launch, payload and experiment activities at the [[Kennedy Space Center]], ISS launch and experiment operations. The HOSC also monitors rocket launches from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]] when a Marshall Center payload is on board.

==History==
[[File:army nasa transfer 01.jpg|thumb|left|Ceremony of transfer from Army to NASA July 1, 1960]]
MSFC arose from the US [[Army Ballistic Missile Agency]] (ABMA) and the Army Ordnance Missile Command (AOMC) centered at Redstone Arsenal. Initially housed at [[Fort Bliss]], TX, the team led by [[Wernher von Braun]] was later transferred to Redstone Arsenal. The transition from military to civilian space exploration came when President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] announced on site the formation of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) on July 1, 1960. At this time Marshall also received its name and a bronze bust of the general from the President. The center became the civilian base for von Braun, his team of [[Operation Paper Clip|German rocket scientists]] and a host of military and civilian contractors.

===Present and future===
[[Image:Marshall Space Flight Center Robotic Lunar lander.jpg|thumb|Marshall Space Flight Center tested a new robotic lunar lander test bed that will aid in the development of a new generation of multi-use landers for robotic space exploration.]]

Modern boosters developed at MSFC included the Space Shuttle liquid and solid propellant engines and the Delta series, used in satellite and [[Mars]] mission launches.

Starting in 2006, MSFC's Exploration Launch Projects Office began work on the new [[Project Constellation]] mission vehicles ([[Ares I]], [[Ares V]] and [[Orion (spacecraft)|Orion]]) which will replace the aging Shuttle fleet as well as transport humans to the Moon, Mars and other future destinations. MSFC is responsible for design and development and testing of the Ares I crew and Ares V cargo launch vehicles while [[Johnson Space Center]] in Houston, Texas has overall responsibility for development. In addition, the MSFC Lunar Precursor and Robotic Program office will manage projects and direct studies on lunar robotic precursor activities across NASA. The Lunar Lander Project Office originally planned to be established at Marshall, has been appointed for development at JSC. This office will be responsible for performing early trade studies and developing requirements for the [[Altair (spacecraft)|Altair]] lunar lander that would transport crew members to and from the surface of the moon.

'''Cornelis de Houtman''' (2 April 1565 – August 1599), brother of [[Frederick de Houtman]], was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] explorer who discovered a new sea route from [[Europe]] to [[Indonesia]] and managed to begin the Dutch spice trade. At the time, the [[Portuguese Empire]] held a monopoly on the spice trade, and the voyage was a symbolic victory for the Dutch, even though the voyage itself was a disaster.

== The voyage ==
In 1592 Cornelis de Houtman was sent by [[Amsterdam]] merchants to [[Lisbon]] to discover as much information on the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]] as he could. At the same time as he returned to Amsterdam, [[Jan Huygen van Linschoten]] returned from India.  The merchants determined that [[Bantam (city)|Bantam]] ([[Banten]]) provided the best opportunity to buy spices.  In 1594 the merchants founded the company '[[compagnie van Verre]]' (meaning &quot;the long-distance company&quot;),  and on April 2, 1595 four ships left Amsterdam: ''Amsterdam'', ''Hollandia'', ''Mauritius'' and ''[[Duyfken]]''.

[[File:De Houtman monument2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Monument for Cornelis and [[Frederick de Houtman]] in [[Gouda]], [[Netherlands]]]]

The voyage was beset with trouble from the beginning. [[Scurvy]] broke out after only a few weeks due to insufficient provisions. Due to quarrels among the captains and traders, several were killed or imprisoned on board. At [[Madagascar]], where a brief stop was planned, further complications led to many more deaths, and the ships remained there for six months on a deathwatch. (The Madagascan bay where they were anchored is now known as the &quot;Dutch Cemetery&quot;.) On June 27, the ships finally arrived at [[Banten]], a northwestern port in [[Java (island)|Java]]. Only around a hundred of the original 249 men had survived the voyage. 

The local Portuguese traders introduced de Houtman to the Banten [[sultan]], who promptly entered into an optimistic treaty with the Dutch, writing &quot;We are well content to have a permanent league of alliance and friendship with His Highness the Prince [[Maurice of  Nassau|Maurice of Nassau, of the Netherlands]] and with you, gentlemen.&quot; Unfortunately, de Houtman was undiplomatic and insulting to the sultan, and was turned away for &quot;rude behaviour&quot; without being able to buy any spices at all.

The ships then sailed east to [[Madura]], but were attacked by pirates on the way. In Madura, they were received peacefully, but de Houtman ordered his men to brutally attack and rape the civilian population in revenge for the unrelated earlier piracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Krakatoa: The Day the World Exploded, August 27, 1883|last= Winchester|first=Simon |authorlink= Simon Winchester|year= 2003|publisher= HarperCollins|location=New York |isbn= 0-06-621285-5|page=17|quote=In retribution for the piracy he ordered a brief campaign of systematic rape and pillage off the coast of Madura.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ships then sailed for [[Bali]], and met with the region's king. They finally managed to obtain a few pots of peppercorns on February 26, 1597. [[Portugal|Portuguese]] ships prevented them from taking in water and supplies at [[St. Helena]]. Out of the 249 man crew, only 87 returned, too weak to moor their ships themselves.

In September 11, 1599, Cornelis de Houtman and his troops got confrontation with [[Aceh]] because of his rude temperament, and soon there were fierce battle with Aceh Navy which led by Aceh's woman admiral, [[Keumalahayati]] (Malahayati). In one battle, [[Keumalahayati|Malahayati]] succeed killed Cornelis de Houtman. And since that accident, [[Queen Elizabeth I]] from [[England]] decided to sent an emissary to Aceh Sultan for asking their permission to enter Malacca Strait.

== Repercussions ==
Though the trip was a humanitarian disaster and financially probably just broke even, it was a symbolic victory. It may be regarded as the start of the Dutch colonisation of [[Indonesia]]. Within five years, sixty-five more Dutch ships had gone East to trade. Soon, the Dutch would fully take over the spice trade in and around the [[Indian Ocean]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{about|psychological temperament|musical temperament|Musical temperament}}

In psychology, '''temperament''' refers to those aspects of an individual's personality, such as [[introversion]] or [[extroversion]], that are often regarded as innate rather than learned. A great many classificatory schemes for temperament have been developed; none, though, has achieved general consensus in academia.&lt;ref name=Kagan/&gt;

Historically, the concept of temperament was part of the theory of [[the four humours]], with their corresponding [[The four temperaments|four temperaments]]. The concept played an important part in pre-modern psychology, and was explored by philosophers such as [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Hermann Lotze]]. [[David W. Keirsey]] also drew upon the early models of temperament when developing the [[Keirsey Temperament Sorter]]. More recently, scientists seeking evidence of a biological basis of personality have further examined the relationship between temperament and character (defined in this context as the ''learnt'' aspects of personality). However, biological correlations have proven hard to confirm.&lt;ref name=Kagan/&gt;

==Overview==
Temperament is determined through specific behavioural profiles, usually focusing on those that are both easily measurable and testable early in childhood. Commonly tested factors include irritability, activity, frequency of smiling, and an approach or avoidant posture to unfamiliar events.&lt;ref name=Kagan&gt;Jerome Kagan, [http://www.enfant-encyclopedie.com/documents/KaganANGxp.pdf &quot;Temperament&quot;], ''Encyclopedia on Early Childhood Development'' 2005&lt;/ref&gt; There is generally a low correlation between descriptions by teachers and behavioural observations by scientists of features used in determining temperament.&lt;ref&gt;Biship GS, Spence SH, McDonald C. Can parents and teachers provide a reliable and valid report of behavioural inhibition? Child Development 2003;74(6):1899-1917&lt;/ref&gt;

Temperament is hypothesized to be associated with biological factors, but these have proven difficult to test directly.&lt;ref name=Kagan/&gt;

==Infants, children and adults==
Alexander Thomas, Stella Chess, Herbert G. Birch, Margaret Hertzig and Sam Korn began the classic New York Longitudinal study in the early 1950s regarding infant temperament (Thomas, Chess &amp; Birch, 1968). The study focused on how temperamental qualities influence adjustment throughout life. Chess, Thomas et al. rated young infants on nine temperament characteristics each of which, by itself, or with connection to another, affects how well a child fits in at school, with their friends, and at home. Behaviors for each one of these traits are on a continuum. If a child leans towards the high or low end of the scale, it could be a cause for concern. The specific behaviors are: activity level, regularity of [[sleep]]ing and [[eating]] patterns, initial reaction, adaptability, intensity of [[emotion]], [[Mood (psychology)|mood]], distractibility, persistence and [[attention span]], and sensory sensitivity. Redundancies between the categories have been found and a reduced list is normally used by psychologists today.&lt;ref name=IReview&gt;Marcel Zentner &amp; John E. Bates, [http://www.childtemperament.org/publications/ejds_02_01_zentner.pdf &quot;Child Temperament: An Integrative Review of Concepts, Research Programs and Measures&quot;]. European Journal of Developmental Science [EJDS]. 2008, Vol. 2, No. 1/2, 7–37&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jerome Kagan]] and his colleagues have concentrated empirical research on a temperamental category termed &quot;reactivity.&quot; Four-month-old infants who became &quot;motorically aroused and distressed&quot; to presentations of novel stimuli were termed ''highly reactive''. Those who remained &quot;motorically relaxed and did not cry or fret to the same set of unfamiliar events&quot; were termed ''low reactive''.&lt;ref name=Kagan&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/1131931 | last1 = Kagan | first1 = J. | year = 1997 | title = Temperament and the reactions to unfamiliarity | url = http://jstor.org/stable/1131931| journal = Child Development | volume = 68 | issue = 1| pages = 139–143 | pmid = 9084130 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These high and low reactive infants were tested again at 14 and 21 months &quot;in a variety of unfamiliar laboratory situations.&quot; Highly reactive infants were predominantly characterized by a profile of high fear to unfamiliar events, which Kagan termed inhibited. Contrastingly, low reactive children were minimally fearful to novel situations, and were characterized by an uninhibited profile (Kagan). However, when observed again at age 4.5, only a modest proportion of children maintained their expected profile due to mediating factors such as intervening family experiences. Those who remained highly inhibited or uninhibited after age 4.5 were at higher risk for developing anxiety and conduct disorders, respectively.&lt;ref name=Kagan/&gt; 

Kagan also used two additional classifications, one for infants who were inactive but cried frequently (distressed) and one for those who showed vigorous activity but little crying (aroused). Followed to age 14–17 years, these groups of children showed differing outcomes, including some differences in central nervous system activity. Teenagers who had been classed as high reactives when they were babies were more likely to be &quot;subdued in unfamiliar situations, to report a dour mood and anxiety over the future, [and] to be more religious.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kagan, J., Snidman, N., Kahn, V., &amp; Towsley, S. (2007). The Preservation of Two Infant Temperaments into Adolescence. Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development, Serial No. 287, 72(2),p.vii&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Solomon Diamond]] described temperaments based upon characteristics found in the animal world: fearfulness, aggressiveness, affiliativeness, and impulsiveness. His work has been carried forward by Buss and Plomin, who developed two measures of temperament: The Colorado Child Temperament Inventory, which includes aspects of Thomas and Chess's schema, and the [[EAS Survey for Children]].&lt;ref name=IReview/&gt;

[[H. Hill Goldsmith]] and [[Joseph Campos]] used emotional characteristics to define temperament, originally analyzing five emotional qualities: motor activity, anger, fearfulness, pleasure/joy, and interest/persistence, but later expanding to include other emotions. They developed several measures of temperament: Lab-TAB and TBAQ.&lt;ref name=IReview/&gt;

Other temperament systems include those based upon theories of adult temperament (e.g. Gray and Martin's [[Temperament Assessment Battery for Children]]).

==Nine Temperament Characteristics of Thomas and Chess==
Research by Thomas and Chess used the following nine temperament traits in children&lt;ref name=psychpage&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychpage.com/family/library/temperm.htm|title=PsychPage.com Child Temperament|accessdate=2009-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schwablearning.org/articles.asp?r=495|title=Your Child's Temperament: Some Basics|last=Firchow|first=Nancy M.L.S.|accessdate=2009-04-21}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ohioline.osu.edu/flm02/FS05.html|title=Ohio State University Extension: Understanding Your Child's Temperament|accessdate=2009-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umext.maine.edu/onlinepubs/htmpubs/4358.htm|title=University of Maine Cooperative Extension: Family Issues Facts|accessdate=2009-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keepkidshealthy.com/development/temperament_personality.html|title=KeepKidsHealthy.com Temperament and Personality|accessdate=2009-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on a classification scheme developed by Dr. Herbert Birch:&lt;ref&gt;Stella Chess and Alexander Thomas, ''Temperament'', Routledge: 1996. ISBN 9780876308356. p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

===Activity===
Activity refers to the child's physical energy. Is the child constantly moving, or does the child have a relaxing approach? A high-energy child may have difficulty sitting still in class, whereas a child with low energy can tolerate a very structured environment. The former may use gross motor skills like running and jumping more frequently. Conversely, a child with a lower activity level may rely more on fine motor skills, such as drawing and putting puzzles together. This trait can also refer to mental activity, such as deep thinking or reading&amp;mdash;activities which become more significant as the person matures.

===Regularity===
Regularity, also known as '''Rhythmicity''', refers to the level of predictability in a child’s biological functions, such as waking, becoming tired, hunger, and bowel movements. Does the child have a routine in eating and sleeping habits, or are these events more random?  For example, a child with a high regularity rating may want to eat at 2&amp;nbsp;p.m. every day, whereas a child lower on the regularity scale may eat at sporadic times throughout the day.

===Initial reaction===
Initial reaction is also known as '''Approach or Withdrawal'''. This refers to how the child responds (whether positively or negatively) to new people or environments. Does the child approach people or things in the environment without hesitation, or does the child shy away? A bold child tends to approach things quickly, as if without thinking, whereas a cautious child typically prefers to watch for a while before engaging in new experiences.

===Adaptability===
Adaptability refers to how long it takes the child to adjust to change over time (as opposed to an initial reaction). Does the child adjust to the changes in their environment easily, or is the child resistant? A child who adjusts easily may be quick to settle into a new routine, whereas a resistant child may take a long time to adjust to the situation.

===Intensity===
Intensity refers to the energy level of a positive or negative response. Does the child react intensely to a situation, or does the child respond in a calm and quiet manner? A more intense child may jump up and down screaming with excitement, whereas a mild-mannered child may smile or show no emotion.

===Mood===
Mood refers to the child’s general tendency towards a happy or unhappy demeanor. All children have a variety of emotions and reactions, such as cheerful and stormy, happy and unhappy. Yet each child biologically tends to have a generally positive or negative outlook. A baby who frequently smiles and coos could be considered a cheerful baby, whereas a baby who frequently cries or fusses might be considered a stormy baby.

===Distractibility===
Distractibility refers to the child’s tendency to be sidetracked by other things going on around them. Does the child get easily distracted by what is happening in the environment, or can the child concentrate despite the interruptions? An easily distracted child is engaged by external events and has difficulty returning to the task at hand, whereas a rarely distracted child stays focused and completes the task at hand.

===Persistence and attention span===
Persistence and attention span refer to the child’s length of time on a task and ability to stay with the task through frustrations—whether the child stays with an activity for a long period of time or loses interest quickly.

===Sensitivity===
Sensitivity refers to how easily a child is disturbed by changes in the environment. This is also called '''sensory threshold''' or '''threshold of responsiveness'''. Is the child bothered by external stimuli like noises, textures, or lights, or does the child seem to ignore them? A sensitive child may lose focus when a door slams, whereas a child less sensitive to external noises will be able to maintain focus.

==&quot;Easy&quot;, &quot;difficult&quot;, and &quot;slow-to-warm-up&quot;==
Thomas, Chess, Birch, Hertzig and Korn found that many babies could be categorized into one of three groups: ''easy'', ''difficult'', and ''slow-to-warm-up'' (Thomas &amp; Chess 1977).&lt;ref name=psychpage/&gt; Not all children can be placed in one of these groups. Approximately 65% of children fit one of the patterns. Of the 65%, 40% fit the easy pattern, 10% fell into the difficult pattern, and 15% were slow to warm up. Each category has its own strength and weakness and one is not superior to another.

Thomas, Chess, Birch, Hertzig and Korn showed that ''Easy'' babies readily adapt to new experiences, generally display positive moods and emotions and also have normal eating and sleeping patterns. ''Difficult'' babies tend to be very emotional, irritable and fussy, and cry a lot. They also tend to have irregular eating and sleeping patterns. ''Slow-to-warm-up'' babies have a low activity level, and tend to withdraw from new situations and people.  They are slow to adapt to new experiences, but accept them after repeated exposure.

Thomas, Chess, Birch, Hertzig and Korn found that these broad patterns of temperamental qualities are remarkably stable through childhood. These traits are also found in children across all cultures.

Thomas and Chess also studied temperament and environment. One sample consisted of white middle class families with high educational status and the other was of Puerto Rican working class families. They found several differences. Among those were:&lt;ref name=psychpage/&gt;

*Parents of middle class children were more likely to report behavior problems before the age of nine and the children had sleep problems. This may be because children start preschool between the ages of three and four. Puerto Rican children under the age of five showed rare signs of sleep problems, however, sleep problems became more common at the age of six.

*Middle class parents also placed great stress on the child’s early development, believing that problems in early ages were indicative of later problems in psychological development, whereas Puerto Rican parents felt their children would outgrow any problems.

*At the age of nine, the report of new problems dropped for middle class children but they rose in Puerto Rican children, possibly due to the demands of school.

==Family life==
===Influences===
Most experts agree that temperament has a [[genetics|genetic]] and [[biology|biological]] basis, although environmental factors and maturation modify the ways a child's personality is expressed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEU-az-NzTc Development of Temperament Symposium (2008). Philoctetes Center, New York; with panelists Sue Carter, Francis Champagne, [[Susan Coates]], Ed Nercessian, Donald Pfaff, [[Daniel Schechter]], Nadia Bruschweiler Stern]&lt;/ref&gt; The term “goodness of fit” refers to the match or mismatch between temperament and other personal characteristics and the specific features of the environment. Differences of temperament or behavior styles between individuals are important in family life. They affect the interactions among family members. While some children can adapt quickly and easily to family routines and get along with siblings, others who are more active or intense may have a difficult time adjusting. The interactions between these children and their parents or siblings are among a number of factors that can lead to stress and friction within the family.

The temperament mix between parents and children also affects family life.  For example, a slow paced parent may be irritated by a highly active child; or if both parent and child are highly active and intense, conflict could result. This knowledge can help parents figure out how temperaments affect family relationships. What may appear to be a behavioral problem may actually be a mismatch between the parent’s temperament and their child’s. By taking a closer look at the nine traits that Thomas and Chess revealed from their study, parents can gain a better understanding of their child’s temperament and their own. Parents may also notice that situational factors cause a child's temperament to seem problematic; for example, a child with low rhythmicity can cause difficulties for a family with a highly scheduled life, and a child with a high activity level may be difficult to cope with if the family lives in a crowded apartment upstairs from sensitive neighbors.

Parents can encourage new behaviors in their children, and with enough support a ''slow-to-warm-up'' child can become less shy, or a ''difficult'' baby can become easier to handle. More recently infants and children with temperament issues have been called &quot;spirited&quot; to avoid negative connotations of &quot;''difficult''&quot; and &quot;''slow to warm up''&quot;. Numerous books have been written advising parents how to raise their spirited youngsters.

===Understanding for improvement===
Understanding a child’s temperament can help reframe how parents interpret children’s behavior and the way parents think about the reasons for behaviors. By parents having access to this knowledge now helps them to guide their child in ways that respect the child’s individual differences. By understanding children’s temperaments and our own helps adults to work with them rather than try to change them. It is an opportunity to anticipate and understand a child’s reaction. It is also important to know that temperament does not excuse a child’s unacceptable behavior, but it does provide direction to how parents can respond to it. Making small and reasonable accommodations to routines can reduce tension. For example a child who is slow paced in the mornings may need an extra half hour to get ready. Knowing who or what may affect the child’s behavior can help to alleviate potential problems. Although children obtain their temperament behaviors innately, a large part that helps determine a child's ability to develop and act in certain ways is determined by the parents. When a parent takes the time to identify and more importantly respond to the temperaments they are faced with in a positive way it will help them guide their child in trying to figure out the world.

Recognizing the child’s temperament and helping them to understand how it impacts his/her life as well as others is important. It is just as important for parents to recognize their own temperaments. Recognizing each individual’s temperament, will help to prevent and manage problems that may arise from the differences among family members.

Temperament continues into adulthood, and later studies by Chess and Thomas have shown that these characteristics continue to influence behavior and adjustment throughout the life-span.

In addition to the initial clinical studies, academic psychologists have developed an interest in the field and researchers such as Bates, Buss &amp; Plomin, [[Jerome Kagan|Kagan]], and Rothbart have generated large bodies of research in the areas of [[personality psychology|personality]], [[neuroscience]], and [[behavioural genetics|behavioral genetics]].

==History==
{{See also|Four humours (disambiguation)}}
In the second century A.D. the physician [[Galen]] described four temperaments - melancholic, phlegmatic, sanguine and choleric - based upon the [[four humours]] or bodily fluids. These became known as the [[four humours|four classical temperaments]].

===Rudolf Steiner's four temperaments===
[[Rudolf Steiner]] emphasized the importance of the [[four humours|four classical temperaments]] in elementary education, the time when he believed the influence of temperament on the personality to be at its strongest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/FourTemps/ForTem_index.html|title=The Four Temperaments: Lecture in Berlin|last=Steiner|first=Rudolf |year=1909|accessdate=2009-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Steiner|first=Rudolf|title=The Four Temperaments|isbn=0910142114}}&lt;/ref&gt; He hypothesized that temperament diminishes in importance as the personality becomes more developed after puberty; that a person's temperament may change, especially in the pre-puberty years; and that temperament is not exclusive: people may combine aspects of several or even, in unusual cases, all of them. He also suggested that people are capable of transforming their own temperaments.

For each temperament Steiner described less and more mature forms: the introspective and sensitive melancholic may be sullen and self-absorbed but can also become a sympathetic helper or a deep thinker. Steiner's temperaments are often used as a basis to describe and understand children during the elementary-school years in [[Waldorf education|Waldorf schools]].

==Popular usages==
It is a popular conception that those who are highly artistic - painters, sculptors, musicians, writers, etc. - often show dramatic swings in emotion, often elevated to extremes: the so-called &quot;artistic temperament&quot;.

'''Sean Astin''' (born February 25, 1971) is an American film actor, [[film director|director]], and [[film producer|producer]] better known for his film roles as Mikey Walsh in ''[[The Goonies]]'', the [[Daniel Ruettiger|title character]] of ''[[Rudy (film)|Rudy]]'', and [[Samwise Gamgee]] in the [[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy|''Lord of the Rings'' trilogy]]. In television, he appeared as [[Lynn McGill]] in the [[24 (season 5)|fifth season]] of ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]''. Most recently, he provided the voice for the title character in Disney's ''[[Special Agent Oso]]''.

== Early life and education ==
Astin was born '''Sean Patrick Duke''' in [[Santa Monica, California]], the son of actress [[Patty Duke]].&lt;ref&gt;He was born under his mother's name, according to the State of California. ''California Birth Index, 1905–1995''. Center for Health Statistics, California Department of Health Services, Sacramento, California. At Ancestry.com&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, it was reported that [[Desi Arnaz, Jr.]] was his biological father.  In 1994, Astin discovered his father was Michael Tell, a music promoter and writer, and publisher of the newspaper ''[[The Las Vegas Israelite]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2004/Feb-29-Sun-2004/news/23327549.html |title=News: NORM: Local publisher's son in spotlight |publisher=reviewjournal.com |date=2004-02-29 |accessdate=2010-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Astin&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Sean Astin Q&amp;A at GenCon 2003 |publisher=TheOneRing.net |date=2003-08-01 |url=http://www.theonering.net/torwp/2003/08/01/25478-sean-astin-qa-at-gencon-2003-2/ |accessdate=2006-12-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Astin2&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=I don't want to play the fat guy or the friend all my life |publisher=Guardian Unlimited |date=2003-12-19 |url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,,1110603,00.html |accessdate=2006-12-13 | location=London | first=Victoria | last=Barrett}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tell's marriage to Patty Duke was [[annulled]] shortly before her marriage in 1972 to actor [[John Astin]], who adopted Sean. In 1973, Duke gave birth to Astin's half-brother [[Mackenzie Astin]], who also became an actor.  Although Patty Duke and John Astin divorced in 1982, Sean Astin has written that he has always considered John his &quot;real&quot; father. 

He attended the [[Crossroads School (Santa Monica, California)|Crossroads High School for the Arts]] and master classes at the [[Stella Adler Conservatory]] in [[Los Angeles]]. Astin graduated from [[UCLA]] with a B.A. in History and English (American literature and culture). An alumnus of [[Los Angeles Valley College]], he serves on the school's Board of Directors of the Patrons Association and the Arts Council.

== Career ==
=== Early career ===
Astin's first acting role was in a 1981 [[television movie]] titled ''Please Don't Hit Me, Mom'', in which he played a child with an abusive mother (portrayed by his real-life mother [[Patty Duke]]). He made his film debut at age 14 as Mikey in ''[[The Goonies]]'' (1985).

Following ''The Goonies'', Astin appeared in several more films, including the [[Disney]] made-for-TV movie, ''The B.R.A.T. Patrol'', opposite [[Nia Long]], [[Tim Thomerson]] and [[Brian Keith]]; ''[[Like Father Like Son (1987 film)|Like Father Like Son]]'' (1987); ''[[The War of the Roses (film)|The War of the Roses]]'' (1989); the [[World War II]] film ''[[Memphis Belle (film)|Memphis Belle]]'' (1990); ''[[Toy Soldiers (film)|Toy Soldiers]]'' (1991); ''[[Encino Man]]'' (1992); and the college football biopic ''[[Rudy (film)|Rudy]]'' (1993), about the life-changing struggles and rewards of the titular character, [[Daniel Ruettiger]].

In 1994, Astin directed and co-produced (with his wife, Christine Astin) the short film ''Kangaroo Court'', which received an Academy Award nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film|Best Live Action Short Film]]. Astin continued to appear in films throughout the 1990s, including the [[Showtime]] science fiction film ''[[Harrison Bergeron (film)|Harrison Bergeron]]'' (1995), the Gulf War film ''[[Courage Under Fire]]'' (1996), and the [[Warren Beatty]] political satire ''[[Bulworth]]'' (1998).

=== ''Lord of the Rings'' ===
In the early 2000s, Astin experienced a career breakthrough with his role as [[Samwise Gamgee]] in [[Peter Jackson]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy|The Lord of the Rings]]'' film trilogy, released in 2001, 2002 and 2003. Along with the many awards bestowed upon the trilogy, particularly its final installment ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|The Return of the King]]'' (winner of eleven [[Academy Awards]], including Best Picture), Astin received many award nominations for his own performance in ''Return of the King'', taking home the [[Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor]] and awards from the [[Las Vegas Film Critics Society]], the [[Seattle Film Critics]], the [[Utah Film Critics Association]], and the [[Phoenix Film Critics Society]]. As an ensemble, the ''Return of the King'' cast received awards from the [[National Board of Review of Motion Pictures]] and the [[Screen Actors Guild]].

While working on ''Lord of the Rings'', Astin persuaded a number of fellow cast and crew members, including director Peter Jackson, to assist him in making his second short film, ''[[The Long and Short of It]]''. The film takes place on a street in [[Wellington, New Zealand]]. ''The Long and Short of It'' premiered at the 2003 [[Sundance Film Festival]] and appears on the DVD for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'', along with a &quot;making of&quot; video.

In 2004, Astin released ''There and Back Again'' (ISBN 0-312-33146-0), a memoir (co-written with Joe Layden) of his film career with emphasis on his experiences with the ''Lord of the Rings'' trilogy. The title is derived from the subtitle of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', by ''Lord of the Rings'' author [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]; the title also appears in the film ''Fellowship of the Ring'' and ''Return of the King''.

=== Post-LOTR career ===
Since ''Lord of the Rings'', Astin has continued to work in film and television. His film roles have included the [[Adam Sandler]] comedies ''[[50 First Dates]]'' and ''[[Click (2006 film)|Click]]''.

In television, Astin guest-starred as [[Lynn McGill]] throughout the [[24 (season 5)|fifth season]] of the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] drama ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]''. He also appeared in the made-for-TV films ''[[Hercules (TV miniseries)|Hercules]]'' and ''[[The Colour of Magic (TV film)|The Colour of Magic]]'' and in episodes of ''[[Monk (TV series)|Monk]]'', ''[[Las Vegas (TV series)|Las Vegas]]'', ''[[My Name is Earl]]'' (in which he parodied his 1993 film ''Rudy'' with co-stars [[Charles S. Dutton]] and [[Chelcie Ross]]), and ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'', among other shows. He directed a 2003 episode of the TV series ''[[Angel (TV series)|Angel]]'', titled [[Soulless (Angel episode)|&quot;Soulless&quot;]].

Astin's career has also expanded to include [[voice-over]] roles. He narrated the American version of the [[Animal Planet]] series ''[[Meerkat Manor]]'', and voices the title character in the animated [[Disney Channel]] series ''[[Special Agent Oso]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Banks | first=Dave | title=Q&amp;A With Sean Astin&amp;nbsp;– Star of Disney's New Kids' Show ''Special Agent Oso'' | url=http://www.wired.com/geekdad/2009/04/special-agent-o/ | date=June 11, 2009 | work=wired.com | publisher=Condé Nast Digital | accessdate=2009-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His other voice work includes ''[[Balto III: Wings of Change]]'' and the video game ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]''.

[[File:Eccehomo1.jpg|thumb|right|370px|''[[Ecce Homo]]'' (&quot;Behold the Man&quot;), [[Antonio Ciseri|Antonio Ciseri's]] depiction of Pilate presenting a scourged [[Jesus]] to the people of [[Jerusalem]].]]
'''Pontius Pilate'''  ({{pron-en|ˈpɒntʃəs ˈpaɪlət}}; [[Latin]]: '''Pontius Pilatus''', [[Greek language|Greek]]: {{polytonic|Πόντιος Πιλᾶτος}}) was the fifth [[Prefect]] of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] province of [[Iudaea Province|Judaea]] from AD 26–36.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/460341/Pontius-Pilate Britannica Online: Pontius Pilate]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilate_Stone&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.livius.org/jo-jz/judaea/judaea.htm&lt;/ref&gt;   The fifth Prefect of Judaea, he is best known as the judge at [[Jesus]]' [[Sanhedrin Trial of Jesus|trial]] and the man who authorized the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]].

Pilate appears in all four [[Biblical canon|canonical]] [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Gospel]]s.   In Matthew, Pilate washes his hands of Jesus and reluctantly sends him to his death.&lt;ref name =&quot;Harris&quot;/&gt;  Mark, depicting Jesus as innocent of plotting against Rome, portrays Pilate as extremely reluctant to execute Jesus, blaming the Jewish priestly hierarchy for his death.&lt;ref name =&quot;Harris&quot;&gt;[[Stephen L Harris|Harris, Stephen L.]], Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Luke, Pilate not only agrees that Jesus did not conspire against Rome, but [[Herod Antipas]], the tetrarch, also finds nothing treasonable in Jesus' actions.&lt;ref name =&quot;Harris&quot;/&gt; In John, Jesus' claim to be the [[Son of Man]] or the Messiah to Pilate and the [[Sanhedrin]] is not portrayed at all.&lt;ref name =&quot;Harris&quot;/&gt;

Pilate's biographical details are unclear and  some Biblical scholars believed that he was a mythical character. Then in 1961 an inscription with his name was found confirming the historicity of Pontius Pilate, and adding to the credence of the Biblical accounts. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.suscopts.org/q&amp;a/index.php?qid=1120&amp;catid=564&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Pilate Stone]])

==Etymology of the name ''Pilatus''==
There are several possible origins for the [[cognomen]] ''Pilatus''. A commonly accepted one is that it means &quot;skilled with the [[javelin]]&quot;. The ''[[pilum]]'' (= javelin) was five feet of wooden shaft and two feet of tapered [[iron]]. When the point penetrated a shield, the shaft would bend and hang down, thus rendering it impossible to throw back.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ann Wroe: Pilate&quot;&gt;Ann Wroe: ''Pilate''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historicity of Pilate==
{{Main|Pilate Stone}}
[[File:Pilate Inscription.JPG|thumb|left|160px|Limestone block discovered in 1961 with Pilate's tribute in Latin to [[Tiberius]]. The words &lt;small&gt;[...]TIVS PILATVS[...]&lt;/small&gt; can be clearly seen on the second line.]]

Little is known of Pilate. There is an old tradition linking the birthplace of Pilate with the small village of [[Bisenti]], Samnite territory, in today's [[Abruzzo]] region of Central Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''[[Historia Ecclesiae]] ii: 7''&lt;/ref&gt; There are ruins of a Roman house known as &quot;The House of Pilate.&quot; Eusebius quoting early apocryphal accounts stated that Pilate suffered misfortune in the reign of [[Caligula]] (AD 37–41), was exiled to Gaul and eventually committed suicide there in [[Vienne, Isère|Vienne]]. &lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''[[Historia Ecclesiae]] ii: 7''&lt;/ref&gt;

The difficulty for historians was that Rome was one of the most bureaucratic civilizations in history. The Romans kept records about every detail of life—births, marriages, adoptions, taxes, olive production, and legal documents. Along with the Roman legions, the official government records were a means to control the lands and peoples they conquered. So why is there a total absence of official Roman records concerning Pilate? &lt;ref&gt;Wayne Jackson, [http://www.christiancourier.com/articles/1061-jesus-christ-myth-or-genuine-history ''Jesus Christ: Myth or Genuine History?''], Christian Courier Publications, 2010.  p 1&lt;/ref&gt;

The first physical evidence relating to Pilate was discovered in 1961, when [[Pilate Stone|a block of limestone]] was found in the Roman theatre at [[Caesarea Maritima]], the capital of the province of [[Iudaea (Roman province)|Iudaea]], bearing a damaged dedication by Pilate of a ''Tiberieum''.&lt;ref&gt;The word ''Tiberieum'' is otherwise unknown: some scholars speculate that it was some kind of structure, perhaps a temple, built to honor the emperor [[Tiberius]].&lt;/ref&gt; This dedication states that he was &lt;small&gt;[...]ECTVS IUDA[...]&lt;/small&gt; (usually read as ''praefectus iudaeae''), that is, ''prefect/governor'' of Iudaea. The early governors of Iudaea were of prefect rank, the later were of procurator rank, beginning with [[Cuspius Fadus]] in 44 AD.

This inscription was discovered in [[Caesarea (Israel)]] by a group led by Antonio Frova and has been dated to 26-37 AD.  Currently the inscription is housed in the [[Israel Museum]], [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;Inventory number is AE 1963 no. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

==Titles and duties==
[[File:Coin-of-Pilate.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Bronze prutah minted by Pontius Pilate.&lt;br /&gt;'''Reverse:''' Greek letters TIBEPIOY KAICAPOC ([[Tiberius]] [[Emperor]]) and date LIS (year 16 = 29/30 A.D) surrounding [[simpulum]] (libation ladle).&lt;br /&gt;'''Obverse:''' Greek letters IOYLIA KAICAPOC ([[Livia|Julia]], the Emperor's (mother)), three bound heads of barley, the outer two heads drooping.]]
Pontius Pilate's title was traditionally thought to have been [[Promagistrate|procurator]], since [[Tacitus]] speaks of him as such.  However, an inscription on a limestone block known as the [[Pilate Stone]] &amp;mdash; a dedication to [[Tiberius Caesar Augustus]] &amp;mdash; that was discovered in 1961 in the ruins of an amphitheater at [[Caesarea Maritima]] refers to Pilate as &quot;[[Prefect]] of Judaea&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Herry Vardaman, &quot;A New Inscription Which Mentions Pilate as &quot;Prefect,&quot;&quot; ''Journal of Biblical Literature'' 81 (1962) 70-71.&lt;/ref&gt;

The title used by the governors of the region varied over the period of the [[New Testament]]. When [[Samaria]], [[Judea]] proper and [[Idumea]] were first amalgamated into the Roman [[Judaea Province]] (which some modern historians spell ''Iudaea'')&lt;ref&gt;H.H. Ben-Sasson, ''A History of the Jewish People'', Harvard University Press, 1976, ISBN 0-674-39731-2, page 246: &quot;When [[Herod Archelaus|Archelaus]] was deposed from the ethnarchy in AD 6, Judea proper, Samaria and Idumea were converted into a Roman province under the name Iudaea.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;, from 6 to the outbreak of the [[First Jewish Revolt]] in 66, officials of the [[Equestrian (Roman)|Equestrian order]] (the lower rank of governors) governed.  They held the Roman title of prefect until [[Herod Agrippa I]] was named [[Herodian Dynasty|King of the Jews]] by [[Claudius]].  After Herod Agrippa's death in 44, when Iudaea reverted to direct Roman rule, the governor held the title procurator.  When applied to governors, this term ''procurator'', otherwise used for financial officers, connotes no difference in rank or function from the title known as prefect.  Contemporary archaeological finds and documents such as the Pilate Inscription from Caesarea attest to the governor's more accurate official title only for the period 6 through 44: [[prefect]]. The logical conclusion is that texts that identify Pilate as procurator are more likely following Tacitus or are unaware of the pre-44 practice.

The procurators' and prefects' primary functions were military, but as representatives of the empire they were responsible for the collection of imperial taxes,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/jesus/jesuskeyfigures.html law.umkc.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; and also had limited judicial functions.  Other civil administration lay in the hands of local government: the municipal councils or ethnic governments such as — in the district of Judaea and Jerusalem — the [[Sanhedrin]] and its president the [[List of High Priests of Israel|High Priest]].  But the power of appointment of the High Priest resided in the Roman legate of [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]] or the prefect of Iudaea in Pilate's day and until 41. For example, [[Caiaphas]] was appointed High Priest of [[Herod's Temple]] by Prefect Valerius Gratus and deposed by Syrian Legate [[Lucius Vitellius]]. After that time and until 66, the Jewish client kings exercised this privilege. Normally, Pilate resided in Caesarea but traveled throughout the province, especially to [[Jerusalem]], in the course of performing his duties. During the [[Passover]], a festival of deep national as well as religious significance for the Jews, Pilate, as governor or prefect, would have been expected to be in Jerusalem to keep order. He would not ordinarily be visible to the throngs of worshippers because of the Jewish people's deep sensitivity to their status as a Roman province.

Equestrians such as Pilate could command legionary forces but only small ones, and so in military situations, he would have to yield to his superior, the legate of Syria, who would descend into Palestine with his legions as necessary.  As governor of Iudaea, Pilate would have small auxiliary forces of locally recruited soldiers stationed regularly in Caesarea and Jerusalem, such as the [[Antonia Fortress]], and temporarily anywhere else that might require a military presence.  The total number of soldiers at his disposal numbered in the range of 3000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Administrative and military organization of Roman Palestine | url = http://www.usd.edu/~clehmann/erp/Palestine/administ.htm | accessdate = 2008-12-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pilate in the canonical Gospel accounts==
[[File:Munkacsy - christ before pilate.jpg|thumb|300px|''Christ before Pilate'', [[Mihály Munkácsy]], 1881]]
{{Gospel_Jesus}}
According to the [[Biblical canon|canonical]] Christian Gospels, Pilate presided at the trial of Jesus and, despite stating that he personally found him not guilty of a crime meriting death, handed him over to crucifixion. Pilate is thus a pivotal character in the [[New Testament]] accounts of Jesus.

According to the New Testament, Jesus was brought to Pilate by the [[Sanhedrin]], who had arrested Jesus and questioned him themselves. The Sanhedrin had, according to the Gospels, only been given answers by Jesus that they considered blasphemous pursuant to Mosaic law, which was unlikely to be deemed a capital offense by Pilate interpreting Roman law.&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=ElINAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA92&amp;lpg=PA92&amp;dq=classical+roman+law+blasphemy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CyKy2iZbQN&amp;sig=kD9puUh_WZSXd5mBEUYJYoG8c_s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ct=result#PPA111,M1&lt;/ref&gt; The  Gospel of Luke&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke%2023:1-2&amp;version=31&lt;/ref&gt; records that members of the Sanhedrin then took Jesus before Pilate where they accused him of sedition against Rome by opposing the payment of taxes to Caesar and calling himself a king. Fomenting tax resistance was a capital offense.&lt;ref&gt;http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Majestas.html&lt;/ref&gt; Pilate was responsible for imperial tax collections in Judaea. Jesus had asked the tax collector Levi, at work in his tax booth in Capernaum, to quit his post. Jesus also appears to have influenced Zacchaeus, &quot;a chief tax collector&quot; in Jericho, which is in Pilate's tax jurisdiction, to resign.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2019:1-9%20;&amp;version=31;&lt;/ref&gt; Pilate's main question to Jesus was whether he considered himself to be the ''King of the Jews'', and thus a political threat. {{bibleverse||Mark||NIV}} in the [[New International Version|NIV]] translation states: &quot;Are you the king of the Jews?&quot; asked Pilate. &quot;It is as you say,&quot; Jesus replied. However, quite a number of other translations render Jesus' reply as variations of the phrase: &quot;Thou sayest it.&quot;([[King James Version]], Mark 15:2); &quot;So you say.&quot; ([[Good News Bible]], Mark 15:2). Whatever degree of confirmation modern interpreters would derive from this answer of Jesus, according to the New Testament, it was not enough for Pilate to view Jesus as a real political threat. In the same Gospel of Mark, 15 verse 5 of [[King James Version]] we read, that &quot;Pilate marveled&quot; (&quot;was amazed&quot; in [[Good News Bible]]).

Following the Roman custom, Pilate ordered a [[INRI|sign posted above Jesus]] on the cross stating &quot;Jesus of Nazareth, The King of the Jews&quot; to give public notice of the legal charge against him for his crucifixion. The chief priests protested that the public charge on the sign should read that Jesus ''claimed'' to be King of the Jews. Pilate refused to change the posted charge, saying &quot;What I've written I've written&quot;, as if weary of legalistic nit-picking. This may have been to emphasize Rome's supremacy in crucifying a Jewish king; it is likely, though, that Pilate was quite irritated by the fact that the Jewish leaders had used him as a marionette and thus compelled him to sentence Jesus to death contrary to his own will (according to Mathew 27:19, even Pilate's wife spoke to him on Jesus' behalf).

The [[Gospel of Luke]] also reports that such questions were asked of Jesus; in Luke's case it being the priests that repeatedly accused him, though Luke states that Jesus remained silent to such inquisition, causing Pilate to hand Jesus over to the jurisdiction ([[Galilee]]) of [[Herod Antipas]]. Although initially excited with curiosity at meeting Jesus, of whom he had heard much, Herod (according to Luke) ended up mocking Jesus and so sent him back to Pilate. This intermediate episode with Herod is not reported by the other Gospels, which appear to present a continuous and singular trial in front of Pilate. Luke, however, made further reference to this involvement of Herod along with Pilate in Jesus' execution and linked it with the prophesy about the Messianic King found in [[Psalm 2]], as we can read in Luke's other book, [[Acts]] 4:24-28. This explains why he counted this episode important.

Unlike the [[synoptic gospels]], the [[Gospel of John]] gives more detail about that dialog taking place between Jesus and Pilate. In John, Jesus seems to confirm the fact of his kingship, although immediately explaining, that &quot;[his] kingdom [was] not of this world&quot;; of far greater importance for the followers of Christ is his own definition of the goal of his ministry on earth at the time. According to Jesus, as we find it written in John 18:37, Jesus thus describes his mission: &quot; [I] came into the world ... ''to bear witness to the truth''; and all who are on the side of ''truth'' listen to [my] voice&quot;, to which Pilate famously replied, &quot;[[What is truth?]]&quot; ({{bibleverse||John|18:38|NIV}})...
[[File:What-is-truth02.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Nikolai Ge]] &quot;[[Christ]] and [[Pilatus]]&quot; ([[What is truth?]]), 1890.]]
Whatever it be that some modern critics want to deduce from those differences, the end result was the same for Jesus and Pilate, as it was in all the other 3 Gospels (Mathew, Mark, Luke). In the same chapter of John 18 verse 38 ([[King James Version]], compare with other versions) the conclusion Pilate made from this interrogation: &quot;I find in him no fault at all&quot;.

The Synoptic Gospels and John then state that it had been a tradition of the Jews to release a prisoner at the time of the [[Passover]]. Pilate offers them the choice of an insurrectionist named [[Barabbas]] or Jesus, somewhat confusing because Barabbas had the full name Jesus Barabbas, and  ''bar-Abbas'' means ''son of the father''. The crowd may not have understood whose release they were asking for and were particularly susceptible to suggestions from the Jewish leaders. The crowd states that they wish to save Barabbas.

Pilate agrees to condemn Jesus to crucifixion, after the Jewish leaders explained to him that Jesus presented a threat to Roman occupation through his claim to the throne of [[King David]] as King of Israel in the royal line of David. The crowd in Pilate's courtyard, according to the Synoptics, had been coached  by the [[Pharisees]] and [[Sadducees]] to shout against Jesus. {{Anchor|hand-washing}}The [[Gospel of Matthew]] adds that before condemning Jesus to death, Pilate washes his hands with water in front of the crowd, saying, &quot;I am innocent of this man's blood; you will see.&quot;

===Responsibility for Jesus' death===
{{Main|Responsibility for the death of Jesus}}
In all gospel accounts, Pilate is reluctant to condemn Jesus, but is eventually forced to give in when the crowd becomes unruly and the Jewish leaders remind him that Jesus's claim to be king is a challenge to Roman rule and to the Roman deification of Caesar. Roman magistrates had wide discretion in executing their tasks, and some readers question whether Pilate would have been so captive to the demands of the crowd. Pilate was later recalled to Rome for his harsh treatment of the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, 49–50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=Cpx86I5IapMC&amp;pg=PA253&amp;lpg=PA253&amp;dq=pilate+slaughter+of+Samaritans |title=History of the Hebrews' Second Commonwealth: With Special Reference to Its Literature, Culture, and the Origin of Rabbinism and Christianity |first=Isaac Mayer |last=Wise |publisher=Bloch &amp; co. |year=1880 |volume= v. 41; v. 992}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pilate was cruel to Galileans in {{bibleverse||Luke|13:1-2}} and Jesus was considered by Pilate to be a Galilean in {{bibleverse||Luke|23:5-7}} since he sent him to Herod and Herod was upset with Pilate up until then {{bibleverse||Luke|23:11-12}} because of his bad treatment of Galileans.  Also see {{bibleverse||Acts|4:24-28}}.

With the [[Edict of Milan]] in AD 313, the state-sponsored [[persecution of Christians]] came to an end, and Christianity became officially tolerated as one of the religions of the Roman Empire. Afterwards, in AD 325 the [[First Council of Nicaea|First Ecumenical Council]] at Nicaea promulgated a creed which was amended at the subsequent [[First Council of Constantinople]] in 381. The [[Nicene Creed]] incorporated for the first time the clause ''was crucified under Pontius Pilate'' (which had already been long established in the [[Old Roman Symbol]], an ancient form of the [[Apostles' Creed]] dating as far back as the 2nd century AD) in a creed that was intended to be authoritative for all Christians in the Roman Empire.

Skeptical scholars consider the various trials of Jesus as described in the Gospels to be largely invention rather than historical record.&lt;ref name = &quot;5G&quot;&gt;[[Robert W. Funk|Funk, Robert W.]], Roy W. Hoover, and the [[Jesus Seminar]]. ''The five gospels.'' HarperSanFrancisco. 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Skeptical scholars also see an authors' agenda behind the descriptions of a reluctant Pilate.&lt;ref name = &quot;5G&quot;/&gt; These scholars argue that gospel accounts place the blame on the Jews, not on Rome, in line with the authors' alleged goal of making peace with the Roman Empire and vilifying the Jews.&lt;ref name = &quot;5G&quot;/&gt;

==Pilate in Jewish literature==
According to [[Philo]], Pilate was &quot;inflexible, he was stubborn, of cruel disposition. He executed troublemakers without a trial.&quot; He refers to Pilate's &quot;venality, his violence, thefts, assaults, abusive behavior, endless executions, endless savage ferocity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Philo, ''On The Embassy of Gauis'' Book XXXVIII 299-305&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Josephus]], Pilate repeatedly almost caused insurrections among the Jews due to his insensitivity to Jewish customs. While Pilate's predecessors had respected Jewish customs by removing all images and effigies on their standards when entering Jerusalem, Pilate allowed his soldiers to bring them into the city at night. When the citizens of Jerusalem discovered these the following day, they appealed to Pilate to remove the ensigns of Caesar from the city. After five days of deliberation, Pilate had his soldiers surround the demonstrators, threatening them with death, which they were willing to accept rather than submit to desecration of Mosaic law. Pilate finally removed the image. The incident proved to be an early example of effective resistance to tyranny by aggressive, nonviolent means.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Jewish War'' 2.9.2-4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=312&amp;letter=P&amp;search=Pilate Jewish Encyclopedia] article on Pilate, retrieved 5 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Josephus recounts another incident in which Pilate spent money from the [[Second Temple|Temple]] to build an aqueduct. When Jews again protested his actions, Pilate had soldiers hidden in the crowd of Jews while addressing them. After giving the signal, Pilate's soldiers randomly attacked, beat, and killed scores of Jews to silence their petitions.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'' 18.3.2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pilate in the Apocrypha==
Little enough is known about Pilate, but tradition has tried to fill the gap. A body of legend grew up around the dramatic figure of Pontius Pilate, about whom the Christian faithful hungered to learn more than the canonical Gospels revealed. [[Eusebius]] (''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia Ecclesiae]]'' ii: 7) quotes some early apocryphal accounts that he does not name, which already relate that Pilate fell under misfortunes in the reign of [[Caligula]] (AD 37–41), was exiled to [[Gaul]] and eventually committed suicide there in [[Vienne, Isère|Vienne]].

Other details come from less creditable sources. His body, says the ''Mors Pilati'' (&quot;Death of Pilate&quot;), was thrown first into the [[Tiber]], but the waters were so disturbed by evil spirits that the body was taken to Vienne and sunk in the [[Rhône River|Rhône]]: a monument at Vienne, called Pilate's tomb, is still to be seen. As the waters of the Rhone likewise rejected Pilate's corpse, it was again removed and sunk in the lake at [[Lausanne]]. The sequence was a simple way to harmonise conflicting local traditions.

The corpse's final disposition was in a deep and lonely mountain [[Tarn (lake)|tarn]], which, according to later tradition, was on a mountain, still called [[Mount Pilatus|Pilatus]] (actually ''pileatus'' or &quot;cloud capped&quot;), overlooking [[Lucerne]]. Every [[Good Friday]], the body is said to reemerge from the waters and wash its hands.

There are many other legends about Pilate in the folklore of Germany, particularly about his birth, according to which Pilate was born in the Franconian city of [[Forchheim (Oberfranken)|Forchheim]] or the small village of [[Hausen]] only 5&amp;nbsp;km away from it. His death was (unusually) dramatised in a medieval [[mystery play|mystery]] [[play cycle]] from Cornwall, the Cornish ''[[Ordinalia]]''.

Pilate's role in the events leading to the crucifixion lent themselves to melodrama, even tragedy, and Pilate often has a role in medieval [[mystery play]]s.

In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], [[Claudia Procula]] is commemorated as a saint,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.suscopts.org/q&amp;a/index.php?qid=1120&amp;catid=564&lt;/ref&gt; but not Pilate, because in the Gospel accounts Claudia urged Pilate not to have anything to do with Jesus. In some Eastern Orthodox traditions, Pilate committed suicide out of remorse for having sentenced Jesus to death.

===''Gospel of Peter''===
{{Main|Gospel of Peter}}
The fragmentary apocryphal [[Gospel of Peter]] exonerates Pilate of responsibility for the crucifixion of Jesus, placing it instead on [[Herod Antipas|Herod]] and the Jews, who unlike Pilate refuse to &quot;wash their hands&quot;.  After the soldiers see three men and a cross miraculously walking out of the tomb they report to Pilate who reiterates his innocence: &quot;I am pure from the blood of the Son of God&quot;.  He then commands the soldiers not to tell anyone what they have seen so that they would not &quot;fall into the hands of the people of the Jews and be stoned&quot;.

===''Acts of Pilate''===
{{Main|Acts of Pilate}}

The 4th century [[apocryphal]] text that is called the ''[[Acts of Pilate]]'' presents itself in a preface (missing in some MSS) as derived from the official acts preserved in the ''[[praetorium]]'' at Jerusalem. Though the alleged Hebrew original of the document is attributed to [[Nicodemus]], the title ''Gospel of Nicodemus'' for this fictional account only appeared in mediaeval times, after the document had been substantially elaborated. Nothing in the text suggests that it is in fact a translation from Hebrew or Aramaic.

This text gained wide credit in the [[Middle Ages]], and has considerably affected the legends surrounding the events of the crucifixion, which, taken together, are called the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]].  Its popularity is attested by the number of languages in which it exists, each of these being represented by two or more variant &quot;editions&quot;: Greek (the original), Coptic, Armenian and Latin versions. The Latin versions were printed several times in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.

One class of the Latin manuscripts contain as an appendix or continuation, the ''Cura Sanitatis Tiberii'', the oldest form of the  [[Saint Veronica|Veronica]] legend.

The ''Acts of Pilate'' consist of three sections, whose styles reveal three authors, writing at three different times.
* The first section (1–11) contains a fanciful and dramatic circumstantial account of the trial of Jesus, based upon {{bibleverse||Luke|23}}.
* The second part (12–16) regards the [[Resurrection]].
* An appendix, detailing the ''Descensus ad Infernos'' was added to the Greek text. This legend of a ''[[Harrowing of Hell]]'' has chiefly flourished in Latin, and was translated into many European versions. It doesn't exist in the eastern versions, Syriac and Armenian, that derive directly from Greek versions.  In it, Leucius and Charinus, the two souls raised from the dead after the Crucifixion, relate to the [[Sanhedrin]] the circumstances of Christ's descent to [[Limbo]]. ([[Leucius Charinus]] is the traditional name to which many late apocryphal ''Acta'' of Apostles is attached.)

[[Eusebius]] (325), although he mentions an ''Acta Pilati'' that had been referred to by [[Justin]] and [[Tertullian]] and other pseudo-Acts of this kind, shows no acquaintance with this work.  Almost surely it is of later origin, and scholars agree in assigning it to the middle of the 4th century.  [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]] refers to an ''Acta Pilati'' similar to this, as early as 376, but there are indications that the current Greek text, the earliest extant form, is a revision of an earlier one.

Justin the Martyr - The First and Second Apology of Justin
Chapter 35-&quot;And that these things did happen, you can ascertain from the Acts of Pontius Pilate.&quot;

The Apology letters were written and addressed by name to the Roman Emperor Pius and the Roman Governor Urbicus. All three of these men lived between AD 138-161.

===Minor Pilate literature===
[[File:Bronze coin of Pontius Pilate Jerusalem mint 26 36 AD.jpg|thumb|Bronze coin of Pontius Pilate, [[Jerusalem]] mint, 26-36 AD.]]
There is a [[pseudepigrapha]] letter reporting on the crucifixion, purporting to have been sent by Pontius Pilate to the Emperor Claudius, embodied in the pseudepigrapha known as the ''[[Acts of Peter and Paul]]'', of which the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]''  states, &quot;This composition is clearly apocryphal though unexpectedly brief and restrained.&quot; There is no internal relation between this feigned letter and the 4th-century ''[[Acts of Pilate]]'' (''Acta Pilati'').

This Epistle or Report of Pilate is also inserted into the [[Pseudo-Marcellus]]  ''[[Passio sanctorum Petri et Pauli]]'' (&quot;Passion of Saints Peter and Paul&quot;). We thus have it in both Greek and Latin versions.

The ''Mors Pilati'' (&quot;Death of Pilate&quot;) legend is a Latin tradition, thus treating Pilate as a monster, not a saint; it is attached usually to the more sympathetic ''[[Gospel of Nicodemus]]'' of Greek origin. The narrative of the ''Mors Pilati'' set of manuscripts is set in motion by an illness of Tiberius, who sends Volusanius to Judaea to fetch the Christ for a cure. In Judaea Pilate covers for the fact that Christ has been crucified, and asks for a delay. But Volusanius encounters [[Saint Veronica|Veronica]] who informs him of the truth but sends him back to Rome with her ''Veronica'' of Christ's face on her kerchief, which heals Tiberius. Tiberius then calls for Pontius Pilate, but when Pilate appears, he is wearing the seamless robe of the Christ and Tiberius' heart is softened, but only until Pilate is induced to doff the garment, whereupon he is treated to a ghastly execution. His body, when thrown into the Tiber, however, raises such storm demons that it is sent to Vienne ([[Gehenna|via gehennae]]) in France and thrown to the Rhone. That river's spirits reject it too, and the body is driven east into &quot;Losania&quot;, where it is plunged in the bay of the lake near [[Lucerne]], near Mont Pilatus &amp;mdash; originally ''Mons Pileatus'' or &quot;cloud-capped&quot;, as [[John Ruskin]] pointed out in ''Modern Painters'' &amp;mdash;  whence the uncorrupting corpse rises every Good Friday to sit on the bank and wash unavailing hands.

This version combined with anecdotes of Pilate's wicked early life were incorporated in [[Jacobus de Voragine]]'s ''[[Golden Legend]]'', which ensured a wide circulation for it in the later Middle Ages. Other legendary versions of Pilate's death exist: [[Antoine de la Sale]] reported from a travel in central [[Italy]] on some local traditions asserting that after death the body of Pontius Pilate was driven until a little lake near [[Vettore Peak]] (2478 m in [[Sibillini Mounts]] ) and plunged in. The lake, today, is still named [[Lago di Pilato]].

In the Cornish cycle of [[mystery play]]s, the &quot;death of Pilate&quot; forms a dramatic scene in the ''Resurrexio Domini'' cycle. More of Pilate's fictional correspondence is found in the minor Pilate apocrypha, the ''Anaphora Pilati'' (''Relation of Pilate''), an ''Epistle of Herod to Pilate'', and an ''Epistle of Pilate to Herod'', spurious texts that are no older than the 5th century.

==Veneration==
The [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] recognized Pilate as a saint in the sixth century, based on the account in the ''[[Acts of Pilate]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12083c.htm ''Pontius Pilate'' from the Catholic Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; as it does his wife, [[Claudia Procula]] whose strange dream of [[Jesus Christ|Christ]] induced her to try and stop his [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]].

==Portrayals==
Plays and films dealing with life of Jesus Christ often include the character of Pontius Pilate due to the central role he played in the final days of Christ's life. Writers have found various reasons to make Pilate a main character and to fill in any unknown details of his life. Pilate has been portrayed in a number of different ways by various writers:
#A weak and harried [[bureaucracy|bureaucrat]]
#A hard governor who rules with an iron fist
#A man who clearly sees how the story of Jesus will affect human history
#A man who regrets his role in Jesus' death (to greater or lesser extents, depending on the work)
#A man who is oblivious to the significance of the [[Galilee|Galilean]] he condemns to death
#A tired governor who doesn't care and wants Jesus out of his hands

* Pilate appears in the [[Mystery Plays]] and [[Passion Plays]], the most notable being in the Cornish cycle in which he is summoned to Rome by [[Tiberius]] and [[death sentence|sentenced to death]] for killing Jesus, but owing to the fact that this crime cannot be contained by earth, sea or water and so immediately proceeds (body and soul, rather than just soul) to [[hell]].

* In the Vestibule of Hell in [[Dante]]'s ''[[The Divine Comedy|Divine Comedy]]'', a figure is seen &quot;who made the great refusal&quot;. This is interpreted to be either Pontius Pilate or [[Pope Celestine V]].
&lt;!--See talk page before editing the next three sections.--&gt;

* Pontius Pilate is portrayed in [[Mikhail Bulgakov]]'s ''[[The Master and Margarita]]'' as being ruthless, complex, and yet human. In this novel, he exemplifies the statement &quot;Cowardice is the worst of vices&quot;, and thus serves as a model, in an allegorical interpretation of the work, of all the people who have &quot;washed their hands&quot; by silently or actively taking part in the crimes committed by [[Joseph Stalin]].
** This novel inspired the song &quot;[[Sympathy for the Devil]]&quot; by The [[Rolling Stones]]'. The title of this song, and its lyrics, seem to be derived from Bulgakov's portrayal of the Devil. Pilate is referenced in the verse: &quot;And I was around when Jesus Christ / had his moment of doubt and pain / made damn sure that Pilate / washed his hands, and sealed his fate&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://dir.salon.com/story/ent/masterpiece/2002/01/14/sympathy/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6595877/sympathy_for_the_devil&lt;/ref&gt;
** ''The Master and Margarita'' and Pilate are also referred to in the [[Pearl Jam]] song &quot;[[Pilate (song)|Pilate]]&quot;, on the album ''[[Yield (album)|Yield]]''. &lt;!--Another Bulgakovian inspiration for a song? Needs a reference of some kind.--&gt;

* The second setting of [[Mikhail Bulgakov]]'s novel, ''[[The Master and Margarita]]'', is the Jerusalem of Pontius Pilate, and concerns Pilate's meeting with Jesus the Nazarene, his recognition of an affinity with and spiritual need for him, and his reluctant but resigned and passive handing over of him to those who wanted to kill him.

* Pilate appears in three stories in [[Karel Čapek]]'s collection ''Apocryphal Tales''. In &quot;Pilate's Evening&quot;, the weary governor wonders why Jesus' friends and relatives did not come to try and save him, and wishes that they had. &quot;Pilate's Creed&quot; features a dialogue between Pilate and [[Joseph of Arimathea]]. Their argument reflects the conflict between [[scepticism|sceptical]] [[humanism]] (Pilate's famous &quot;What is truth?&quot;) and [[religion|religious]] certainty (Joseph's reply, &quot;The truth in which I believe&quot;). &quot;The Crucifixion&quot; features a world-weary Pilate disgusted with the political machinations that led to Jesus' condemnation.

* In [[Roger Caillois]]' short novel ''Pontius Pilate'' (1961), Pilate is portrayed as a vacillating colonial administrator who, during the day after Jesus' arrest, receives advice from his wife, from [[Judas Iscariot]] and from a [[Chaldea|Chaldaean]] friend who has amassed an immense knowledge of the world's various religions. In the end, he is shown as &quot;a man who despite every hindrance succeeded in being brave&quot;.

* In ''The Flame and the Wind'', a novel by [[John Blackburn (author)|John Blackburn]], the aged Pilate is wracked by guilt over Jesus' death and directs his heir to find out if Jesus was really the [[Son of God]].

* In the [[Anatole France]] short story ''The Procurator of Judaea'', Pilate has retired to [[Sicily]] to become a [[gentleman]] [[farmer]]. This story is an example of the &quot;oblivious&quot; interpretation of Pilate. He has forgotten everything about Jesus and the part that he (Pilate) played in his trial.

* The [[Netherlands|Dutch]] writer [[Simon Vestdijk]]'s 1938 novel ''[[De nadagen van Pilatus]]'' (''The Last Days of Pilate'') presents an account of Pilate's life after the crucifixion.

* [[Ann Wroe]]'s ''Pontius Pilate: The Biography of an Invented Man'' is an attempt to provide the obscure official with a biography suitable to the man who is so influential to the Christian story. **The [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] debuted a performance piece called ''The Pilate Workshop'' in the summer of 2004, which attempted to cast Wroe's research in the form of a mystery play.

* Pilate is mentioned in the [[theme song]] for [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Nextwave]] series in a list of enemies, along with a monster, a pirate, an electric [[emu]], a giant sky-rat, and a [[midget]] [[Hitler]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

* Retired [[California]] politician [[James R. Mills]] wrote a novel titled ''Gospel According to Pontius Pilate'' in 1978.  Pilate is described as an ordinary, cynical politician whose primary concern is to keep the local population content and maintain social order, rather than particular sense of rightness.

* In the [[rock opera]] ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'', Pilate has three songs. In &quot;Pilate's Dream&quot;, he foresees that history will mention his name and leave him the blame of Jesus' death. In the song &quot;Pilate and Christ&quot;, an arrogant and mocking Pilate perhaps realizing manipulation by the Sanhedrin, tries to prevent Jesus' death by sending Jesus to Herod. &quot;You're Herod's race! You're Herod's case!&quot;. In the song &quot;Trial Before Pilate&quot;, a sympathetic Pilate pleads with Jesus to speak to him, saying that he believes the accused has &quot;done no wrong&quot; but &quot;ought to be locked up&quot; for insanity. Receiving no answer from the silent Jesus, Pilate eventually grows exasperated and tells him, &quot;Die if you want to, you misguided [[martyr]].&quot; [[Barry Dennen]] played Pilate on the &quot;Brown Album&quot;, on Broadway and in the 1973 film version of the musical, directed by [[Norman Jewison]].

* The Collection of Short Stories ''The Night Chicago Died'' by [[Tom Wessex]] contains a story entitled &quot;[[An Afternoon on Skull Hill]]&quot;, in which the author supposes that [[Gestas]], one of the thieves crucified with Christ, was in fact Pilate's illegitimate son.

* Pontius Pilate is mentioned in the drama ''[[The Crucible]]'' by [[Arthur Miller]]. Protagonist John Proctor yells &quot;Pontius Pilate! God will not let you wash your hands of this!&quot;, to Reverend Hale as Proctor's wife is being arrested.

* In Nicolas Notovith's &quot;The Lost Years of Jesus&quot; (1894), an apocryphal Gospel he claims to have found in the Leh lamasery, [[Ladak]], Pilatus is seen as an evil man and the Jews as mild and compassionate.

* In the 2004 [[Superman]] storyline &quot;[[Superman: For Tomorrow|For Tomorrow]]&quot;, a story with strong [[messiah|messianic]] themes, a priest dying of cancer (and a confidant of Superman) is transformed into [[Equus (comics)|a biological war machine]], codenamed &quot;Pilate&quot;, and rampages through a paradise dimension created by Superman. He retains enough of his humanity to regret his murders and sacrifices himself.

* In [[Jeffrey Archer]]'s 1980 collection of short stories ''[[A Quiver Full of Arrows]]'', one of the stories, &quot;The First Miracle&quot; tells of how a 12-year-old Pontius Pilate meets [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] and [[Virgin Mary|Mary]] as they arrive in [[Bethlehem]], and gives them the food that his mother had sent him to buy.

*In [[Toni Morrison]]'s book ''[[Song of Solomon]]'', Pilate is the name of Macon Dead's sister

* [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] wrote that Pilate is the one powerful personality in the Gospels.

* Pilatus is the central figure in ''[[The Karma Killers]]'' a 2009 novel by [[Angelo Paratico]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.amazon.com/KARMA-KILLERS-Novel-ANGELO-PARATICO/dp/1440142653/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1252125970&amp;sr=8-1&lt;/ref&gt;

* In the 2006 musical event Pilate is portrayed by Keith Allen [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0795422/]

===Portrayals in film===
* In the 1935 film ''[[The Last Days of Pompeii (1935 film)|The Last Days of Pompeii]]'', Pilate (played by [[Basil Rathbone]]) is portrayed as a man consumed with guilt over having crucified [[Jesus]].

* [[Richard Boone]] played a calm and stern, though, slightly guilt-ridden Pilate in ''[[The Robe (film)|The Robe]]'' (1953). His action in condemning [[Jesus]] is particularly singled out as unjust by the principal character Marcellus.

* [[Frank Thring]] portrayed a somewhat jaded though shrewd Pilate in ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' (1959). He is a good friend of Judah Ben-Hur's Roman adoptive father Quintus Arrius, but he reminds Ben-Hur that he wields the emperor's own authority to keep peace in Judea.

* [[Hurd Hatfield]] portrayed Pilate in [[Nicholas Ray]]'s film ''[[King of Kings (film)|King of Kings]]'' (1961). The film portrays an overtly militaristic Pilate &amp;mdash; his caravan is attacked by [[Barabbas]] and his followers in the movie &amp;mdash; and he is also characterised as being vain and aloof. His interest in the life and actions of [[Jesus]] before his trial and crucifixion, listening to detailed reports, is fanciful historically.

* [[Telly Savalas]] portrayed Pilate in [[George Stevens]]' film ''[[The Greatest Story Ever Told]]'' (1965) as a gruff [[Strongman (politics)|strongman]]. Although Pilate would prefer to crucify Barabbas rather than Jesus, he is not portrayed as being especially sympathetic towards Jesus. As Jesus is led out to crucifixion, Pilate is portrayed as thinking the words of the [[Apostles' Creed]]: &quot;suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead, and buried.&quot; [[Angela Lansbury]] played his wife [[Pontius Pilate's wife|Claudia Procula]] in one of the many cameo roles in the film.

* [[Barry Dennen]] portrayed a sympathetic Pilate in [[Norman Jewison]]'s musical [[Jesus Christ Superstar]] (1973)who is very reluctant to put Christ to death, but succumbs under Jewish mob pressures.

* [[Rod Steiger]] portrayed Pilate in [[Franco Zeffirelli]]'s TV miniseries ''[[Jesus of Nazareth (miniseries)|Jesus of Nazareth]]'' (1977). In this version, Pilate is angered by Jesus' refusal to defend himself. After condemning Jesus to death, Pilate is told by one of his aides that he cannot release Barabbas, &quot;an assassin and enemy of Rome.&quot; Pilate replies, &quot;I wonder...Who is the real enemy?&quot; In [[Anthony Burgess]]'s novel ''[[Man of Nazareth]]'', based on ''Jesus of Nazareth'', Pilate is portrayed as being more sympathetic towards Jesus, recognising the validity of his doctrine and even telling Jesus he is free to go, although Jesus tells Pilate he has to condemn him to death.

* In the comedy film ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian]]'' (1979), Pilate is portrayed by [[Michael Palin]] as a foolish man who has trouble pronouncing the letter &quot;r&quot; ([[Rhotacism|pronouncing it like a &quot;w&quot;]]). He is also unable to remember who is in his prisons, and seems to be easily offended, as in the scene where he feels his guards are &quot;insulting&quot; his friend Biggus Dickus when they laugh at his name. Pilate later chides the Jewish crowds for laughing at Biggus Dickus' lisp, telling them &quot;This man commands a cwack legion!&quot; and &quot;He [[wank (sexual act)|wanks]] as high as any in Wome!&quot; It has also been speculated that his impediment is the reason the crowd chose [[Barabbas]] over [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]] in the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion narrative]].&lt;ref&gt;http://classicfilm.about.com/od/comedies/fr/Life_of_Brian.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[David Bowie]] portrayed Pilate in [[Martin Scorsese]]'s ''[[The Last Temptation of Christ (film)|The Last Temptation of Christ]]'' (1988), based on the novel by [[Nikos Kazantzakis]]. In the film, Pilate is portrayed as world-weary and somewhat sympathetic towards Jesus, but believes he has to die to preserve the status quo.

* In the 1999 film ''[[Jesus (1999 film)|Jesus]]'', Pilate is played by [[Gary Oldman]] as a cynical manipulator of the events surrounding Christ's death.

* In [[Mel Gibson]]'s ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'' (2004), Pilate is played by Bulgarian actor [[Hristo Shopov]]. He is extremely reluctant to sentence Jesus to death and very sympathetic to him. This is partly because of his wife's strange dreams and the value he places on superstition. As a result he only condemns Jesus to death when he has no other option. He is visibly shocked and scared of the mob's relentlessness when he is asked to crucify Jesus and release Barrabas.

The '''Season of the Inundation''' (the [[Manuel de Codage|MdC transliteration]] of the [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] term is ''Axt'', and it is occasionally written as '''Akhet''') &lt;ref&gt;Nigel C. Strudwick, Texts from the Pyramid Age, SBL 2005, p.87&lt;/ref&gt; is the first season in the ancient [[Egyptian calendar]] and corresponds roughly with '''early September to early January'''.

The [[Ancient Egyptian]]s marked the beginning of their year by the rising of the [[Nile]]. This event was vital to the people because the waters left behind fertile silt and moisture, which was the cause of the fertility of the [[Egypt|Egyptian nation]].

The Season of Inundation falls between early September and early January, and begins after the 5- or 6-day intercalary 13th month, known as [[Pi Kogi Enavot]] (the little month).

==Lunar calendar==
The [[Ancient Egyptians]] used this name in both their lunar and their civil calendars. The lunar calendar began with the [[heliacal rising]] of [[Sirius]], which during the time of the ancient Egyptians occurred around September 20 (according to the [[Julian calendar]] &amp;mdash; in Egypt the [[Sothic cycle|Sothic year]] happens to be of the same length as the Julian); the four [[month]]s of their lunar calendar are roughly equivalent to the period from the rising of Sirius to the middle of November.

==Civil calendar==
The New Year's Day of the civil calendar, on the other hand, moved through the seasons over time, by about one day every four years. Therefore, the Season of Inundation  does not continuously match any part of the modern calendar.

==Months==
The Season of Inundation consists of four 30-day months. These months can be either referred to by number (months 1 through 4) or by names as follows:
* Month 1 = [[Thout]]
* Month 2 = [[Paopi]]
* Month 3 = [[Month of Hathor|Hathor]]
* Month 4 = [[Koiak]]

The Season of Inundation is preceded by the [[Season of the Harvest]] and is followed by the [[Season of the Emergence]]&lt;ref&gt;Marshall Clagett, ''Ancient Egyptian Science: A Source Book'', Diane 1989, ISBN 0871692147, p.5&lt;/ref&gt;.

The '''Season of the Emergence''' ([[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] ''prt''), or '''Proyet''', or '''Peret''' &lt;ref&gt;Nigel C. Strudwick, ''Texts from the Pyramid Age'', SBL 2005, p.103&lt;/ref&gt;, is the second season or [[Winter]] season of the [[Egyptian calendar]]. It falls roughly between early January and early May.&lt;ref&gt;David P. Silverman, Ancient Egypt, Duncan Baird Publishers, London 1997. p.93&lt;/ref&gt;). Proyet falls after the [[Season of the Inundation]], also known as '''Akhet'''. 

Proyet was the season where the annual Nile flood retreated leaving a rich and fertile layer of black silt, made as the floods picked up black soil and rocks, over the land making it ideal for planting crops.  The Egyptian growing season consisted of the 120 days, where planting and growth took place. It is followed by the 120 days of the [[Season of the Harvest]].

The Season of the Emergence is known as '''Proyet''' in both the lunar and the civil Egyptian calendars. The months of the lunar calendar are roughly equivalent to the period from early January to early May. Since the civil calendar moved through the seasons over time, losing about one day every four years, this season does not continuously match any part of the modern calendar.

==Months==
The Season of Emergence consists of four 30-day months. These months can be either referred to by number (months 5 through 8) or by names as follows:
* Month 5 = [[Month of Tobi|Tobi]]
* Month 6 = [[Meshir]]
* Month 7 = [[Paremhat]]
* Month 8 = [[Paremoude]]

The Season of Emergence is preceded by the [[Season of the Inundation]] and is followed by the [[Season of the Harvest]].&lt;ref&gt;Marshall Clagett, ''Ancient Egyptian Science: A Source Book'', Diane 1989, ISBN 0871692147, p.5&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Season of the Harvest''' (known in [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] as '''Shemu''' or '''Shomu''' - [[Manuel de Codage|transliterated]] as Smw) is the third and final season of the [[Egyptian calendar]]. The word Shemu literally translates as &quot;low-water&quot;, and falls roughly between early May and early September. During this season, the crops of the grain harvest are collected.&lt;ref&gt;David P. Silverman, Ancient Egypt, Duncan Baird Publishers, London 1997. p.93&lt;/ref&gt; '''Shemu''' is preceded by the [[Season of the Emergence]] ('''Proyet'''), and is followed by the [[Season of the Inundation]] ('''Akhet''').

During '''Shemu''', the Egyptian farmers would harvest their crops - in clear contrast to the practice of their contemporaries in the ancient world, who would be just beginning to plant their crops at this time of the year. '''Shemu''' is also known as the '''Summer Season''' or the '''Dry Season'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.let.leidenuniv.nl/saqqara/Egyptology/Glossary/Inundation.html Leiden University]&lt;/ref&gt; and is occasionally written as '''Shomu'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-541508/shomu Britannica: shomu]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The ancient [[Egyptians]] used this name in both their lunar and their civil calendars. The months of the lunar calendar are roughly equivalent to the period from early May to the heliacal rising of [[Sirius]] around the beginning of September. Since the civil calendar moved through the seasons over time, losing about one day every four years, this season does not continuously match any part of the modern calendar.

==Months==
The Season of Harvest consists of four 30-day months plus one little month of 5 or 6 days. This little month was considered to be an intercalary period, which brought the season of 365 days. These months can be either referred to by number (months 9 through 13) or by names as follows:
* Month 9 = [[Pashons]]
* Month 10 = [[Paoni]]
* Month 11 = [[Epip]]
* Month 12 = [[Mesori]]
* Month 13 = [[Pi Kogi Enavot]] (the little month)

The Season of Harvest is preceded by the [[Season of the Emergence]] and is followed by the [[Season of the Inundation]].&lt;ref&gt;Marshall Clagett, ''Ancient Egyptian Science: A Source Book'', Diane 1989, ISBN 0871692147, p.5&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jean-François Millet (II) 008.jpg|thumb|''Le vanneur'' by [[Jean-François Millet]], a 19th-century depiction of winnowing by fan]]
[[File:Winnowing machine.jpg|upright|thumb|right|Chinese rotary fan winnowing machine, from the ''Tiangong Kaiwu'' encyclopedia (1637) by [[Song Yingxing]]]] 
'''Wind winnowing''' is an [[agriculture|agricultural]] method developed by ancient cultures for separating [[cereal|grain]] from [[chaff]]. It is also used to remove [[weevils]] or other pests from stored grain. [[Threshing]], the separation of grain or seeds from the husks and straw, is the step in the chaff-removal process that comes before winnowing.  &quot;Winnowing the chaff&quot; is a common expression.

In its simplest form it involves throwing the mixture into the air so that the wind blows away the lighter chaff, while the heavier grains fall back down for recovery. Techniques included using a winnowing fan (a shaped basket shaken to raise the chaff) or using a tool (a [[winnowing fork]] or shovel) on a pile of harvested grain.

==In China==
In Ancient China the method was improved by mechanisation with the development of the rotary winnowing fan, which used a cranked fan to produce the airstream.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.tu-berlin.de/~china/deutsch/abstracts/Vogel.html The Question of the Transmission of the Rotary Winnowing Fan from China to Europe: Some New Findings], Hans Ulrich Vogel, 8th International Conference on the History of Science in China&lt;/ref&gt; This was featured in [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]]'s book the [[Technology of the Song Dynasty#Wind power|''Nong Shu'']] of 1313 AD.

==In Europe==
In [[Saxon]] settlements such as one identified in Northumberland as [[Bede]]'s Ad Gefrin &lt;ref&gt;Münzenberg, Hessen. Chapel and Palas (G.Binding, Burg Münzenberg, 1962)&lt;/ref&gt; (now called [[Yeavering]]) the buildings were shown by an excavator's reconstruction to have opposed entries.  In barns a draught created by the use of these opposed doorways was used in winnowing.&lt;ref&gt;M.W.Thompson, The Rise of the Castle, (Cambridge University Press, 1991), 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique developed by the Chinese was not adopted in Europe until the 18th century, when winnowing machines used a 'sail fan'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antiquefarmtools.info/page3.htm Broadcasting and winnowing], Antique Farm Tools&lt;/ref&gt; The rotary winnowing fan was exported to Europe, brought there by Dutch sailors between 1700 and 1720. Apparently they had obtained them from the Dutch settlement of Batavia in Java, Dutch East Indies. The Swedes imported some from south China at about the same time and Jesuits had taken several to France from China by 1720. Until the beginning of the 18th century, no rotary winnowing fans existed in the West.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Temple, The Genius of China, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1737 [[Andrew Rodger]], a farmer on the estate of [[Cavers (parish)|Cavers]] in [[Roxburghshire]], developed a winnowing machine for corn, called a 'Fanner'. These were successful and the family sold them throughout Scotland for many years. Some Scottish Presbyterian ministers saw the fanners as sins against God, for wind was a thing specially made by him and an artificial wind was a daring and impious attempt to usurp what belonged to God alone.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, Robert (1885). ''Domestic Annals of Scotland''. Edinburgh : W &amp; R Chambers. p. 397.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Greek culture==
&lt;!-- The page called Liknon directs to this section; if changing section title, please also edit the redirect page --&gt;
The winnowing-fan (λίκνον [''líknon''], also meaning a &quot;cradle&quot;) featured in the rites accorded [[Dionysus]] and in the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]]: &quot;it was a simple agricultural implement taken over and mysticised by the religion of Dionysus,&quot; [[Jane Ellen Harrison]] remarked.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, ''Prolegomean to the Study of Greek Religion'', 3rd ed. (1922:159).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dionysus Liknites'' (&quot;Dionysus of the winnowing fan&quot;) was wakened by the Dionysian women, in this instance called ''[[Thyia]]des'', in a cave on [[Parnassus]] high above [[Delphi]]; the winnowing-fan links the god connected with the [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mystery religion]]s to the agricultural cycle, but mortal Greek babies too were laid in a winnowing-fan.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Kerenyi]], ''Dionysus: Archetypal Image of Indestructible Life'' (1976:44).&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Callimachus]]' ''Hymn to Zeus'', [[Adrasteia]] lays the infant Zeus in a golden ''líknon'', her goat suckles him and he is given honey.

In the [[Odyssey]], the dead oracle [[Teiresias]] tells [[Odysseus]] to walk away from Ithaca with an oar until a wayfarer tells him it is a winnowing fan, and there to build a shrine to Poseidon.

==In the New Testament==
[[File:C+B-Agriculture-Fig12-Winnowing.PNG|upright|thumb|left|Use of winnowing forks.]]
In the [[Gospel according to Matthew]] 3,12, a sentence introduces the separation of wheat and chaff (good and bad) by &quot;His winnowing fan is in his hand&quot; ([[American Standard Bible]] translation). The [[New International Version]] translates the term as &quot;[[winnowing fork]]&quot;.

==In the United States==
The development of the [[winnowing barn]] allowed rice plantations in [[South Carolina]] to increase their yields dramatically.

'''Billie Jean King''' (''née'' '''Moffitt'''; born November 22, 1943 in [[Long Beach, California]]) is a former professional [[tennis]] player from the United States. She won 12 [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] singles titles, 16 Grand Slam women's doubles titles, and 11 Grand Slam mixed doubles titles. King has been an advocate against [[sexism]] in sports and society. She is known for &quot;[[The Battle of the Sexes (Tennis)|The Battle of the Sexes]]&quot; in 1973, in which she defeated [[Bobby Riggs]], a former [[Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]] men's singles champion.&lt;ref name = &quot;ESPN-BillieJean&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00016060.html |title=Billie Jean Won for All Women |accessdate=2007-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King is the founder of the [[Women's Tennis Association]], the [[Women's Sports Foundation]], and [[World Team Tennis]], which she founded with her former husband, Lawrence King.

==Personal life==
'''Billie Jean Moffitt''' was born into a conservative [[Methodism|Methodist]] family, the daughter of a fireman father&lt;ref name=&quot;Official Wimbledon profile of BJK&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.wimbledon.org/en_GB/about/history/billiejean_king.html |title=Official Wimbledon profile of Billie Jean King |accessdate=2007-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and housewife mother. Her younger brother [[Randy Moffitt]] grew up to become a professional [[baseball]] player, pitching for 12 years in the major leagues for the [[San Francisco Giants]], [[Houston Astros]], and [[Toronto Blue Jays]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.baseball-reference.com/m/moffira01.shtml |title= Randy Moffitt Statistics |accessdate=2007-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Billie Jean attended [[Long Beach Polytechnic High School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kingsschools.org/pr_si-article.asp |title= Press Release - King's Schools |accessdate=2007-02-15 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061224233102/http://kingsschools.org/pr_si-article.asp &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After graduating, she attended [[California State University, Los Angeles]] (CSULA) because her parents could not afford Stanford or the University of Southern California (USC).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stanfordreview.org/article/billy-jean-king-commemorates-title-ixs-35th-annive/ Billy (sic) Jean King Commemorates Title IX's 35th Anniversary]&lt;/ref&gt;

She married Lawrence King in Long Beach, California on September 17, 1965.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Billie Jean King of Her Family&quot;, ''Long Beach Press-Telegram'', November 23, 1965, page C-4&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1971, she had an [[abortion]], revealed to the public in a ''Ms. Magazine'' article in 1972 by Lawrence without consulting Billie Jean in advance.&lt;ref name = &quot;NYTimes-20060426&quot;&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/26/arts/television/26stan.html The Legacy of Billie Jean King, an Athlete Who Demanded Equal Play]&lt;/ref&gt; King said in her 1982 autobiography that she decided to have an abortion because she believed her marriage was not solid enough to bring a child into her family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Deford, Frank; King, Billie Jean |title=Billie Jean |publisher=Viking |location=New York, N.Y |year=1982 |pages=19|isbn=0-670-47843-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Billie Jean and Lawrence divorced in 1987.

By 1968, King realized that she was interested in women,&lt;ref name = &quot;NYTimes-20060426&quot; /&gt; and in 1971, King began an intimate relationship with her secretary, Marilyn Barnett.  King acknowledged the relationship when it became public in a May 1981 &quot;[[palimony]]&quot; lawsuit filed by Barnett, making King the first prominent professional female athlete to come out as a lesbian.&lt;ref name = &quot;TimesOnline-20071209&quot;&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/tennis/article3021888.ece The Big Interview: Billie Jean King], 9 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; King said that she had wanted to retire from competitive tennis in 1981 but could not afford to because of the lawsuit. &quot;Within 24 hours [of the lawsuit being filed], I lost all my endorsements; I lost everything.  I lost $2 million [${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|2000000|1981|r=0}}}} in current dollar terms] at least, because I had longtime contracts. I had to play just to pay for the lawyers. In three months I went through $500,000 [${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|500000|1981|r=0}}}} in current dollar terms]. I was in shock. I didn't make $2 million in my lifetime, so it's all relative to what you make.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/sports/other_sports/tennis/articles/2006/12/03/no_royalty_like_king/?page=4 No royalty like King]&lt;/ref&gt;  King said in 1998 that [[Martina Navratilova]] was not supportive when King was [[outing|outed]], resulting in their relationship having a &quot;very bad five years.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-20979892.html Billie Jean King (interview)]&lt;/ref&gt;  Speaking about the lawsuit in 2007, 26 years after it was filed, King said:
{{cquote|It was very hard on me because I was outed and I think you have to do it in your own time. Fifty per cent of gay people know who they are by the age of 13. I was in the other 50%. I would never have married Larry if I’d known. I would never have done that to him. I was totally in love with Larry when I was 21.&lt;ref name = &quot;TimesOnline-20071209&quot; /&gt;}}
Concerning the personal cost of concealing her sexuality for so many years, King said:
{{cquote|I wanted to tell the truth but my parents were homophobic and I was in the closet. As well as that, I had people tell me that if I talked about what I was going through, it would be the end of the women's tour.  I couldn't get a closet deep enough. I've got a homophobic family, a tour that will die if I come out, the world is homophobic and, yeah, I was homophobic. If you speak with gays, bisexuals, lesbians and transgenders, you will find a lot of homophobia because of the way we all grew up.  One of my big goals was always to be honest with my parents and I couldn't be for a long time. I tried to bring up the subject but felt I couldn't. My mother would say, &quot;We’re not talking about things like that&quot;, and I was pretty easily stopped because I was reluctant anyway. I ended up with an eating disorder that came from trying to numb myself from my feelings. I needed to surrender far sooner than I did.  At the age of 51, I was finally able to talk about it properly with my parents and no longer did I have to measure my words with them. That was a turning point for me as it meant I didn't have regrets any more.&lt;ref name = &quot;TimesOnline-20071209&quot; /&gt;}}

On August 12, 2009, she was awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by President [[Barack Obama]] for her work advocating for the rights of women and the [[LGBT|lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgendered]] community.  &quot;This is a chance for me — and for the United States of America — to say thank you to some of the finest citizens of this country and of all countries&quot;, President Obama said.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/13/us/politics/13obama.html Obama Gives Medal of Freedom to 16 Luminaries]&lt;/ref&gt;

She is a friend of [[Elton John]] and was a friend of [[Charles M. Schulz]].

In 1999, King was elected to serve on the Board of Directors of [[Altria|Philip Morris Incorporated]], garnering some criticism from anti-[[tobacco]] groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cleanlungs.com/education/features/king.html Billie Jean King Elected To Philip Morris Board]&lt;/ref&gt;  She no longer serves in that capacity.

King appeared as a judge on ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'', one of her favorite television shows,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0973361/&lt;/ref&gt; on April 27, 2007. King also appeared on ''[[Ugly Betty]]'' on May 21, 2009.

King currently resides in New York and Chicago&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imgspeakers.com/_images/speakers/KingBillieJean.pdf Billie Jean King, Mother of Modern Sports]&lt;/ref&gt; with her partner, [[Ilana Kloss]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/s_445847.html Evert, Navratilova weigh in on tennis legend Billie Jean King]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tennis career==
===Playing style and personality===
King learned to professionally play tennis on the public courts of Long Beach, California.&lt;ref name=&quot;ITHF biography&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tennisfame.com/famer.aspx?pgID=867&amp;hof_id=171 |title= International Tennis Hall of Fame biography of Billie Jean Moffitt King |accessdate=2007-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was an aggressive, hard-hitting net-rusher,&lt;ref name = &quot;ESPN-BillieJean&quot; /&gt; with excellent speed.  [[Chris Evert]], however, said about King, &quot;Her weakness is her impatience.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,907800-2,00.html Chris Evert: Miss Cool on the Court]&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning her motivations in life and tennis, King said, &lt;blockquote&gt;Any time you're satisfied with mediocrity, any time you take away incentive from human beings, you've blown it.  I'm a perfectionist much more than I'm a super competitor, and there's a big difference there....  I've been painted as a person who only competes.  ...  But most of all, I get off on hitting a shot correctly.  ...  Any woman who wants to achieve anything has to be aggressive and tough, but the press never sees us as multidimensional.  They don't see the emotions, the downs....&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Billie Jean King a perfectionist&quot;, New Mexican, [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], June 1, 1980, page C-7&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a 1984 interview just after she had turned 40, King said, &lt;blockquote&gt;Sometimes when I'm watching someone like Martina [Navratilova], I remember how nice it was to be No. 1.  Believe me, it's the best time in your life.  Don't let anyone ever tell you different.  But then I think about the emotional and physical effort it takes to be No. 1, and I realize it's not there anymore.  I know that, and it's OK.  It's part of the process.  My only regret is that I had to do too much ''off'' the court.  Deep down, I wonder how good I really could have been if I [had] concentrated just on tennis.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Challenge of Her Life - Billie Jean at 40&quot;, ''[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]]'' magazine, ''Syracuse Herald Journal'', January 8, 1984, page 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Julie Heldman]], who frequently played King but never felt close to her, said about King's personality, &lt;blockquote&gt;One of the reasons I've never gotten close to Billie Jean is that I've never felt strong enough to survive against that overwhelming personality of hers. People talk about me being the smart one. Let me tell you, Billie Jean's the smartest one, the cleverest one you'll ever see. She was the one who was able to channel everything into winning, into being the most consummate tennis player.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mrs. Billie Jean King!&quot;&gt;[http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1089860/4/index.htm Mrs. Billie Jean King!]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; [[:fr:Kristien Shaw-Kemmer|Kristen Kemmer Shaw]], another frequent opponent of King, said, &lt;blockquote&gt;For a time, I think I was as close to Billie Jean as anyone ever was. But as soon as I got to the point where I could read her too well, she tried to dissociate the relationship. She doesn't want to risk appearing weak in front of anybody. She told me once that if you want to be the best, you must never let anyone, anyone, know what you really feel. You see, she told me, they can't hurt you if they don't know.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mrs. Billie Jean King!&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

King once said, &quot;Victory is fleeting. Losing is forever.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allthingswilliam.com/victory.html |title=all things William |accessdate=2007-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning the qualities of a champion tennis player, King said,

{{quote|The difference between me at my peak and me in the last few years of my career is that when I was the champion I had the ultimate in confidence.  When I decided, under pressure ... that I had to go with my very weakest shot - forehand down the line - I was positive that I could pull it off ... when it mattered the most.  Even more than that; going into a match, I knew it was my weakest shot, and I knew in a tight spot my opponent was going to dare me to hit it, and I knew I could hit it those two or three or four times in a match when I absolutely had to.  ...  The cliché is to say that ... champions play the big points better.  Yes, but that's only the half of it.  The champions play their weaknesses better....&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Deford, Frank; King, Billie Jean |title=Billie Jean |publisher=Viking |location=New York, N.Y |year=1982 |pages=96–7 |isbn=0-670-47843-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a May 19, 1975, ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' article about King, [[Frank Deford]] noted that she had become something of a sex symbol and said, &quot;Billie Jean cackles when the matter of her being a sex symbol is raised. 'Hysterical! Hysterical! Me, with these little short legs!' But she is practical enough to realize that a guy who buys a ticket to look at the girls has bought a ticket as sure as the guy who buys a ticket to look at the girls' forehands.  ...  Billie Jean herself not only thinks that sex is a dandy thing to have lurking around sports, but she also employs sex as sort of the ultimate gauge of equality between women's and men's athletics. This may be described as the Get-It Quotient.... 'There's a lot of ugly fellas among the male athletes, but just because they're athletes they get it all the time, don't they? Now, never mind prize money and publicity and all that. When we reach the point where all the women athletes are getting it, too, regardless of their looks, just like the fellas, then we've really arrived.{{' &quot;}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Mrs. Billie Jean King!&quot; /&gt;

===The early years: 1959 through 1965===
====1959====
In 1959, the 15-year-old King had her Grand Slam debut at the [[US Open (tennis)|U.S. Championships]], losing to [[:fr:Justina Bricka|Justina Bricka]] in the first round 4–6, 7–5, 6–4 after having had a match point.  In July and August, King played four of the tournaments that comprised the &quot;Eastern Grass Court Circuit.&quot; At the Middle States Grass Court Championships in [[Philadelphia]], King lost to [[Nancy Richey Gunter]] in the quarterfinals. At the [[Pennsylvania]] Lawn Tennis Championships, King lost to [[Karen Hantze Susman]] in the quarterfinals. At the Philadelphia and District Women's Grass Court Championships, King defaulted her quarterfinal match with [[Kathy Chabot]] while trailing 6–1, 1–2. At the Eastern Grass Court Championships, King lost to [[Maria Bueno]] in the third round 6–4, 6–4.  In her final adult tournament of the year, King lost (7–5 in the third set) to [[Ann Haydon Jones]] in the third round of the Pacific Southwest Championships.

[[Alice Marble]], winner of 18 Grand Slam titles from 1936 through 1940, began coaching King on weekends during 1959, saying, &quot;Clyde Walker has given Billie all the tools she needs to be a winner.  Now all she needs is confidence and time.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Teele, Jack, &quot;The Sports Beat&quot;, ''Long Beach Press-Telegram'', November 12, 1959, page D-3&lt;/ref&gt;  King, however, believes that [[Maureen Connolly Brinker]] almost permanently destroyed her confidence as a player when Connolly Brinker mistakenly thought that the type of [[reverse psychology]] which motivated herself to become the World No. 1 also would work on King.  While the 15-year-old King was practicing on the Junior [[Wightman Cup]] team, Connolly Brinker took her to dinner and said, &quot;Look, I just want to let you know: you'll never make it.  So don't bother.&quot;  About ten years later, King learned the truth.  While watching the team practice, Connolly Brinker had asked an assistant coach of the team who the top prospect was.  When the coach responded with [[Tory Fretz]], Connolly Brinker laughed, pointed at King, and said, &quot;Oh no, the only one with any real chance at all is that one.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Deford, Frank; King, Billie Jean |title=Billie Jean |publisher=Viking |location=New York, N.Y |year=1982 |pages=96|isbn=0-670-47843-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1960====
In 1960, King won her first adult tournament title at the Philadelphia and District Women's Grass Court Championships, defeating Karen Hantze Susman in the quarterfinals.  At the U.S. Championships, King was defeated in the third round by seventh-seeded [[Bernice Carr Vukovich]] of South Africa 7–5, 6–4.  King lost four significant matches to veteran players.  In May, she lost in the quarterfinals of the Southern California Championships 6–4, 2–6, 6–4 to 43 year old [[Dorothy Cheney|Dorothy &quot;Dodo&quot; Cheney]], who was the first American to win the singles title at the [[Australian Championships]] in 1938.  Two months later, King lost in the second round of the U.S. Women's Clay Court Championships 1–6, 6–0, 6–3 to 35 year old but second-seeded [[Dorothy Head Knode]], who went on to win the title for the fourth and final time.  The next week, King was defeated in the semifinals of the Pennsylvania Lawn Tennis Championships 6–4, 2–6, 6–2 by 42 year old [[Margaret Osborne duPont]], a six-time Grand Slam singles champion.  In her last tournament of the year, King, the top seed, lost in the quarterfinals of the U.S. Hard Court Championships to Cheney 6–3, 4–6, 6–3.

====1961====
King first gained international recognition in 1961 when, at age 17, she won the women's doubles title at [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] in her first attempt while partnering Karen Hantze Susman.&lt;ref name=&quot;Official Wimbledon profile of BJK&quot; /&gt;  Although unseeded, King and Susman defeated the top seeded team of [[Renee Schuurman Haygarth]] and [[Sandra Reynolds Price]] in the quarterfinals and the third seeded team of [[Margaret Court]] and [[Jan Lehane O'Neill]] in the final. In second round singles play at [[1961 Wimbledon Championships - Women's Singles|Wimbledon]], fifth-seeded [[Yola Ramírez Ochoa]] defeated King in a two-day match on Centre Court&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Collins, Bud |title=My Life With the Pros |publisher=E.P. Dutton |location=New York |year=1989 |pages=261 |isbn=0-525-24659-2 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 11–9, 1–6, 6–2 after King had received a first round bye.  Earlier in the year, King lost to Susman in the final of the Southern California Championships but successfully defended her title in Philadelphia and won the Pennsylvania Lawn Tennis Championships for the first time.  Christine Truman Janes, the fourth seed, defeated the unseeded King in the second round of the U.S. Championships 6–3, 3–6, 6–2.  At the Pacific Southwest Championships, King lost in the third round to Dorothy &quot;Dodo&quot; Cheney (then 45 years old) 6–1, 3–6, 6–3 for the third consecutive time.  Playing in the Wightman Cup for the first time, King defeated Ann Haydon Jones but lost to Janes.

====1962====
In 1962, King lost to Dorothy &quot;Dodo&quot; Cheney (now 45 years old) for the fourth time in four career matches, this time in the semifinals of the [[Ojai, California|Ojai]] Valley Tennis Tournament.  The following week, Karen Hantze Susman defeated King in the final of the Southern California Championships for the second consecutive year.  In only her second career singles match at [[1962 Wimbledon Championships - Women's Singles|Wimbledon]], King upset Margaret Court, the World No. 1 and top seed, in a second round match by attacking Court's forehand&lt;ref&gt;Billie Moffitt's Strategy - Attack!&quot;, ''Kansas City Times'', June 27, 1962, page 15&lt;/ref&gt; after Court had led in the third set 3–0, 5–2, and served at 5–3 (30–15).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Starr, Cynthia; King, Billie Jean |title=We Have Come a Long Way: The Story of Women's Tennis |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |year=1988 |pages=106 |isbn=0-07-034625-9 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the first time in Wimbledon history that the women's top seed had lost her first match.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Wimbledon Upset&quot;, Beckley (West Virginia) Post-Herald, June 27, 1962, page 2&lt;/ref&gt;  King eventually reached the quarterfinals, losing to fifth-seeded Ann Haydon Jones 6–3, 6–1.  One month later, Court defeated King in the semifinals of both the Pennsylvania Lawn Tennis Championships (6–4, 6–3) and the Eastern Grass Court Championships (6–3, 6–4).  At the Wightman Cup, King and Susman lost their only match of the tie to the team of Jones and Christine Truman Janes.  At the U.S. Championships, King got injured and retired from her first round match with [[Victoria Palmer]] while leading 8–6, 0–5.  King ended her year by losing to Renee Schuurman Haygarth in the quarterfinals of the Pacific Southwest Championships.

====1963====
[[Image:Billy Jean Moffitt.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Billie Jean Moffitt (later King) at the [[Tennis Ireland|Irish Open]] at Fitzwilliam LTC, Dublin in the 1960s where she won her first international title]]
In 1963, King won the Southern California Championships for the first time, defeating [[Darlene Hard]] in the final.  At [[1963 Wimbledon Championships - Women's Singles|Wimbledon]], the unseeded King defeated seventh-seeded Maria Bueno in the quarterfinals 6–2, 7–5 and third-seeded Ann Haydon Jones in the semifinals 6–4, 6–4 before losing the final to top-seeded Margaret Court.  The following week, King won her first international title at the Irish Championships.  In Wightman Cup competition, King defeated Christine Truman Janes 6–4, 19–17 and Jones.  King was seeded third at the U.S. Championships but lost her fourth round match with unseeded [[Dierdre Catt|Dierdre Catt Keller McMahon]].  At the year ending Pacific Southwest Championships, King defeated Jones and Bueno before losing to Hard in the final.

====1964====
In 1964, King won four relatively minor titles but lost to Margaret Court in the [[1964 Wimbledon Championships - Women's Singles|Wimbledon]] semifinals 6–3, 6–4.  King defeated Ann Haydon Jones at both the Wightman Cup and [[Fed Cup]] but lost to Court in the final of the Federation Cup 6–2, 6–3.  At the U.S. Championships, fifth-seeded Nancy Richey Gunter upset third-seeded King in the quarterfinals 6–4, 6–4.  Late in the year, King decided to make a full-time commitment to tennis.  She said,

{{quote|I was in my third year as a history major at [[Los Angeles State College]]....  I still had my dream of being Number 1 in tennis, but I had yet to win a major singles title.  I finally realized that I would never know whether I could make it unless I made a commitment to play full-time.  I was able to make that commitment when Robert Mitchell, the same businessman who had helped Margaret Smith [Court], offered to pay my way to Australia so that I could train under the great Australian coach Mervyn Rose.  I told my friends I was going to Australia to become the best player in the world.  It was a frightening admission, but it helped to drive me.  Merv Rose was exactly what I needed.  He made radical alterations in my game, changing my swooping, wristy forehand and backhand into the crisp efficient strokes of a champion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Starr, Cynthia; King, Billie Jean |title=We Have Come a Long Way: The Story of Women's Tennis |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |year=1988 |pages=113–4 |isbn=0-07-034625-9 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While in Australia, King played three tournaments to end the year, losing in the quarterfinals of the Queensland Grass Court Championships, the final of the [[N.S.W. Open/Medibank International|New South Wales Championships]] (to Court), and the third round of the [[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] Championships.

====1965====
In early 1965, King continued her 3-month tour of Australia.  She lost in the final of the [[South Australia]]n Championships and the first round of the Western Australia Championships.  At the Federation Cup in Melbourne, King defeated Ann Haydon Jones to help the United States defeat the United Kingdom in the second round.  However, Margaret Court again defeated King in the final.  At the [[Australian Open|Australian Championships]] two weeks later, King lost to Court in the semifinals 6–1, 8–6.  At [[1965 Wimbledon Championships - Women's Singles|Wimbledon]], King again lost in the semifinals, this time to Maria Bueno 6–4, 5–7, 6–3.  King's last tournament of the year was the U.S. Championships, where she defeated Jones in the quarterfinals (16–14, 6–2) and Bueno in the semifinals.  In the final, King led 5–3 in both sets, was two points from winning the first set, and had two set points in the second set&lt;ref&gt;Santana, Miss Smith Grab U.S. Tennis Championships&quot;, ''Pacific Stars &amp; Stripes'', September 14, 1965, page 20&lt;/ref&gt; before losing to Court 8–6, 7–5.  King said that losing while being so close to winning was devastating, but the match proved to her that she was &quot;good enough to be the best in the world.  I'm going to win Wimbledon next year.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Starr-BillieJean&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Starr, Cynthia; King, Billie Jean |title=We Have Come a Long Way: The Story of Women's Tennis |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |year=1988 |pages=114 |isbn=0-07-034625-9 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  King won six tournaments during the year.  For the first time in 81 years, the annual convention of the [[United States Tennis Association|United States Lawn Tennis Association]] overruled its ranking committee's recommendation to award King the sole U.S. No. 1 position and voted 59,810 to 40,966 to rank Nancy Richey Gunter and King as co-U.S. No. 1.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Billie Jean Must Share No. 1 Rating&quot;, ''Independent Press-Telegram'' (Long Beach, California), February 6, 1966, page C-1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prime competitive years: 1966 through 1975===
====Overview of these years====
From 1966 through 1975, King won 32 of her career 39 Grand Slam titles, including all 12 of her Grand Slam singles titles, 9 of her 16 Grand Slam women's doubles titles, and 10 of her 11 Grand Slam mixed doubles titles.

Six of King's Grand Slam singles titles were at Wimbledon, four were at the U.S. Championships/Open, one was at the [[French Open]], and one was at the Australian Championships.  King reached the final of a Grand Slam singles tournament in 16 out of 25 attempts and had a 12–4 win–loss record in those finals.  In the nine tournaments that she failed to reach the final, she was a losing semifinalist twice and a losing quarterfinalist five times.  From 1971 through 1975, King won seven of the ten Grand Slam singles tournaments she played.  She won the last seven Grand Slam singles finals she contested, six of them in straight sets and four of them against [[Evonne Goolagong Cawley]].  All but one of King's Grand Slam singles titles were on [[grass court|grass]].

King's Grand Slam record from 1966 through 1975 was comparable to that of Margaret Court, her primary rival during these years.  One or both of these women played 35 of the 40 Grand Slam singles tournaments held during this period, and together they won 24 of them.  During this period, Court won 31 of her career 64 Grand Slam titles, including 12 of her 24 Grand Slam singles titles, 11 of her 19 Grand Slam women's doubles titles, and 8 of her 21 Grand Slam mixed doubles titles.  Court reached the final of a Grand Slam singles tournament in 14 out of 25 attempts and had a 12–2 win–loss record in those finals.  Court won 7 of the 12 Grand Slam finals she played against King during these years, including 2–1 in singles finals, 4–1 in women's doubles finals, and 1–3 in mixed doubles finals.

King was the year-ending World No. 1 in six of the ten years from 1966 through 1975.  She was the year-ending World No. 2 in three of those years and the World No. 3 in the other year.

King won 97 of her career 129 singles titles during this period and was the runner-up in 36 other tournaments.

====1966====
In 1966, King defeated Dorothy &quot;Dodo&quot; Cheney (then 49 years old) for the first time in five career matches, winning their semifinal at the Southern California Championships 6–0, 6–3.  King also ended her nine match losing streak to Margaret Court by defeating her in the final of the South African Tennis Championships.  At the Wightman Cup just before [[1966 Wimbledon Championships - Women's Singles|Wimbledon]], King defeated [[Virginia Wade]] and Ann Haydon Jones.  After thirteen unsuccessful attempts to win a Grand Slam singles title from 1959 through 1965, King at the age of 22 finally won the first of her six singles titles at Wimbledon and the first of twelve Grand Slam singles titles overall, defeating Court in the semifinals 6–3, 6–3 and Maria Bueno in the final.  King credited her semifinal victory to her forehand down the line, a new shot in her repertoire.&lt;ref name = &quot;Starr-BillieJean&quot; /&gt;  She also said that the strategy for playing Court is, &quot;Simple.  Just chip the ball back at her feet.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1078753/index.htm Manolo is king, and a King is queen]&lt;/ref&gt;  At the U.S. Championships, an ill King was upset by [[Kerry Melville Reid]] in the second round.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.elementfx.com/1966-tennis.html News Archive; 1966: Tennis]&lt;/ref&gt;

====1967====
King successfully defended her title at the South African Tennis Championships in 1967, defeating Maria Bueno in the final.  She played the French Championships for the first time in her career,&lt;ref&gt;King claims that the United States Lawn Tennis Association prohibited her from playing the French Championships earlier in her career because the association needed her to play grass court tournaments in the United States to draw crowds. {{cite book |author=Starr, Cynthia; King, Billie Jean |title=We Have Come a Long Way: The Story of Women's Tennis |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |year=1988 |pages=114 |isbn=0-07-034625-9 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; falling in the quarterfinals to [[Annette Van Zyl|Annette Van Zyl DuPlooy]] of South Africa.  At the Federation Cup one week later in West Germany on [[clay court|clay]], King won all four of her matches, including victories over DuPlooy, Ann Haydon Jones, and [[Helga Niessen Masthoff]].  King then successfully switched surfaces and won her second consecutive [[1967 Wimbledon Championships - Women's Singles|Wimbledon]] singles title, defeating Virginia Wade in the quarterfinals 7–5, 6–2 and Jones.  At the Wightman Cup, King again defeated Wade and Jones.  King won her second Grand Slam singles title of the year when she won the U.S. Championships for the first time and without losing a set, defeating Wade, DuPlooy, [[Françoise Durr]], and Jones in consecutive matches.  Jones pulled her left hamstring muscle early in the final and saved four match points in the second set before King prevailed.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Aussie, Billie Jean Capture U.S. Titles&quot;, ''Oakland Tribune'', September 11, 1967, page 40-E&lt;/ref&gt;  King won the singles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles titles at both Wimbledon and the U.S. Championships, the first woman to do that since Alice Marble in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.elementfx.com/1967-tennis.html News Archive; 1967: Tennis]&lt;/ref&gt;  King then returned to the Australian summer tour in December for the first time since 1965, playing seven events there and [[Judy Tegart Dalton]] in six of those events (winning four of their matches).  King lost in the quarterfinals of the [[Medibank International|New South Wales Championships]] in Sydney to Dalton after King injured her left knee in the second game of the third set of that match.&lt;ref&gt;Injury May Force King Out Of Tennis Tourney&quot;, ''Florence Morning News'', November 25, 1967, page 6&lt;/ref&gt;  However, King won the Victorian Championships in [[Melbourne]] the following week, defeating Dalton, Reid, and [[Lesley Turner Bowrey]] in the last three rounds.  At a team event in [[Adelaide]], King won all three of her singles and doubles matches to help the U.S. defeat Australia 5–1.  To finish the year, King lost to Dalton in the final of the South Australian Championships in Adelaide.

====1968====
In early 1968, King won three consecutive tournaments to end her Australian tour.  In [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], King won the Western Australia Championships, defeating Margaret Court in the final.  In [[Hobart, Tasmania|Hobart]], King won the [[Tasmania]]n Championships by defeating Judy Tegart Dalton in the final.  King then won the Australian Championships for the first time, defeating Dalton in the semifinals and Court in the final.  King continued to win tournaments upon her return to the United States, winning three indoor tournaments before Nancy Richey Gunter defeated King in the semifinals of the [[Madison Square Garden]] Challenge Trophy amateur tournament in New York City before 10,233 spectators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0F15F8345D147493C2AA1788D85F4C8685F9 Miss Richey Upsets Mrs. King, 4-6, 7-5, 6-0, to Gain Garden Tennis Final]&lt;/ref&gt;  The match started with Gunter taking a 4–2 lead in the first set, before King won 9 of the next 10 games.  King served for the match at 5–1 and had a match point at 5–3 in the second set; however, she lost the final 12 games and the match 4–6, 7–5, 6–0.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.elementfx.com/1968-tennis.html News Archive; 1968: Tennis]&lt;/ref&gt;  King then won three consecutive tournaments in Europe before losing to Ann Haydon Jones in the final of a professional tournament at Madison Square Garden.  Playing the French Open for only the second time in her career and attempting to win four consecutive Grand Slam singles titles (a &quot;non-calendar year Grand Slam&quot;), King defeated Maria Bueno in a quarterfinal before losing to Gunter in a semifinal 2–6, 6–3, 6–4.  King rebounded to win her third consecutive [[1968 Wimbledon Championships - Women's Singles|Wimbledon]] singles title, defeating Jones in the semifinals and Dalton in the final.  At the [[1968 U.S. Open - Women's Singles|US Open]], King defeated Bueno in a semifinal before being upset in the final by Virginia Wade.  On September 24, she had surgery to repair cartilage in her left knee&lt;ref&gt;[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10D16FE3B5D11738FDDAD0A94D1405B888AF1D3 Mrs. King Undergoes Successful Surgery]&lt;/ref&gt; and did not play in tournaments the remainder of the year. King said that it took eight months (May 1969) for her knee to recover completely from the surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Surgery for Billie Jean|work=Independent Press-Telegram|location=Long Beach, California |date=July 11, 1970 |page=C-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, King said that her doctors predicted in 1968 that her left knee would allow her to play competitive tennis for only two more years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=King Will Resume Singles Competition|work=The Pocono Record| location=Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania |date=January 20, 1977 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1969====
King participated in the 1969 Australian summer tour for the second consecutive year.  Unlike the previous year, King did not win a tournament.  She lost in the quarterfinals of the Tasmanian Championships and the semifinals of the New South Wales Championships.  At the Australian Open, King defeated 17 year old Evonne Goolagong Cawley in the second round 6–3, 6–1 and Ann Haydon Jones in a three-set semifinal before losing to Margaret Court in a straight-sets final.  The following week, King lost in the semifinals of the New Zealand Championships.  Upon her return to the United States, King won the Pacific Coast Pro and the Los Angeles Pro.  King then won two tournaments in South Africa, including the South African Open.  During the European summer [[clay court]] season, King lost in the quarterfinals of both the [[Rome Masters|Italian Open]] and the French Open.  On grass at the Wills Open in [[Bristol]], United Kingdom, King defeated Virginia Wade in the semifinals (6–8, 11–9, 6–2) before losing to Court.  At [[1969 Wimbledon Championships - Women's Singles|Wimbledon]], King lost only 13 points while defeating [[Rosemary Casals]] in the semifinals 6–1, 6–0;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Mrs. King Crushes Foe&quot;, ''Abilene (Texas) Reporter-News'', July 3, 1969, page 12-A&lt;/ref&gt; however, Jones upset King in the final and prevented King from winning her fourth consecutive singles title there.  The week after, King again defeated Wade to win the Irish Open for the second time in her career.  In the final Grand Slam tournament of the year, King lost in the quarterfinals of the [[1969 U.S. Open - Women's Singles|US Open]] to Nancy Richey Gunter 6–4, 8–6.  This was the first year since 1965 that King did not win at least one Grand Slam singles title.  King finished the year with titles at the [http://www.countrywideclassic.com/history.htm Pacific Southwest Open] in Los Angeles, the [[Stockholm]] Indoors, and the [[Midland, Texas|Midland (Texas)]] Pro.  She said during the Pacific Southwest Open, &quot;It has been a bad year for me.  My left knee has been OK, but I have been bothered by a severe tennis elbow for seven months.  I expect to have a real big year in 1970, though, because I really have the motivation now.  I feel like a kid again.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Billie Jean, Pancho Gain Pacific Southwest Finals&quot;, ''Independent Press-Telegram'', Long Beach, California, September 28, 1969, page S-6&lt;/ref&gt;

====1970====
In 1970, Margaret Court won all four Grand Slam singles tournaments and was clearly the World No. 1.  King lost to Court three times in the first four months of the year, in Philadelphia, Dallas, and [[Johannesburg]] (at the South African Open).  Court, however, was not totally dominant during this period as King defeated her in Sydney and [[Durban, South Africa]].  Where Court dominated was at the Grand Slam tournaments.  King did not play the Australian Open.  King had leg cramps and lost to Helga Niessen Masthoff of West Germany in the quarterfinals of the French Open 2–6, 8–6, 6–1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70717F93F5812718DDDAD0894DE405B808BF1D3 Mrs. King, Hobbled by Leg Cramps, Loses to Miss Niessen in French Tennis]&lt;/ref&gt;  At [[1970 Wimbledon Championships - Women's Singles|Wimbledon]], Court needed seven match points&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wimbledon2000/fans_guide/769768.stm Classic women's singles finals]&lt;/ref&gt; to defeat King in the final 14–12, 11–9 in one of the greatest women's finals in the history of the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wimbledon.org/en_GB/about/history/margaret_court.html Margaret Court/Smith (Wimbledon official website)]&lt;/ref&gt;  On July 22,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Billie Jean Has Knee Surgery&quot;, ''Wisconsin State Journal'', July 23, 1970, section 2, page 3&lt;/ref&gt; King had right knee surgery, which forced her to miss the [[1970 U.S. Open - Women's Singles|US Open]].  King returned to the tour in September, where she had a first round loss at the [[Virginia Slims]] Invitational in Houston and a semifinal loss at the Pacific Coast Championships in [[Berkeley, California]].  To close out the year, King in November won the Virginia Slims Invitational in [[Richmond, Virginia]] and the Embassy Indoor Tennis Championships in London.  During the European clay court season, King warmed-up for the French Open by playing in [[Monte Carlo]] (losing in the semifinals), winning the Italian Open (saving three match points against Virginia Wade in the semifinals),&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Billie Jean King, Julia Heldman score victories&quot;, ''Winona (Minnesota) Daily News'', April 26, 1970, page 7b&lt;/ref&gt; playing in [[Bournemouth]] (losing to Wade in the quarterfinals), and playing in [[Berlin, Germany|Berlin]] (losing to Masthoff in the semifinals).  The Italian Open victory was the first important clay court title of King's career.  Along the way, she defeated Masthoff in a three-set quarterfinal and Wade in a three-set semifinal, saving two match points at 4–5 in the second set.  The twelfth game of that set (with King leading 6–5) had 21 deuces and lasted 22 minutes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Tingay, Lance |title=The Guinness Book of Tennis Facts &amp; Feats |publisher=Guinness Superlatives |location=Enfield, Middlesex |year=1983 |pages=26 |isbn=085112268x |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Wade saving seven set points and holding sixteen game points before King won.  In Wightman Cup competition two weeks before Wimbledon but played at the [[All England Club]], King defeated both Wade and Ann Haydon Jones in straight sets.

====1971====
Although King won only one Grand Slam singles title in 1971, this was the best year of her career in terms of tournaments won (17).  According to the International Tennis Hall of Fame, she played in 31 singles tournaments and compiled a 112–13 win–loss record.&lt;ref name=&quot;ITHF biography&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tennisfame.com/famer.aspx?pgID=867&amp;hof_id=171 |title= International Tennis Hall of Fame biography of Billie Jean Moffitt King |accessdate=2007-02-15 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061119112817/http://www.tennisfame.com/famer.aspx?pgID=867&amp;hof_id=171 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She started the year by winning eight of the first thirteen tournaments she played, defeating Rosemary Casals in seven finals.  King's five losses during this period were to Françoise Durr (twice), Casals (once), Ann Haydon Jones (once), and Chris Evert (in [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]]).  The St. Petersburg tournament was King's first since having an abortion that caused her to miss the Virginia Slims tour event in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]].  At the time, King said that retiring from the match with Evert after splitting the first two sets was necessary because of leg cramps.  But in early 1972, King admitted that cramps associated with the abortion caused the retirement.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Tennis Pro Favors Abortion&quot;, ''Tucson (Arizona) Daily-Citizen'', February 23, 1972, page 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the tournament in [[Hurlingham]], United Kingdom in early May, King lost a second round match to an old rival, Christine Truman Janes (now 30 years old), 6–4, 6–2.  But King recovered the next week to win the [[Qatar Telecom German Open|German Open]] in [[Hamburg]] on [[clay court|clay]].  Four weeks later at the [[Queen's Club]] tournament in London, King played Margaret Court for the first time in 1971, losing their final.  At [[1971 Wimbledon Championships - Women's Singles|Wimbledon]], King defeated Janes in the fourth round (6–2, 7–5) and Durr in the quarterfinals before losing unexpectedly to Evonne Goolagong Cawley in the semifinals 6–4, 6–4.  Two weeks after Wimbledon, King won the grass court tournament in [[Hoylake]], United Kingdom, beating Virginia Wade, Court, and Casals in the last three rounds.  She then played two clay court tournaments in Europe, winning neither, before resuming play in the United States.

In August, King won the indoor [[Houston]] tournament and the U.S. Women's Clay Court Championships in [[Indianapolis]].  King then switched back to grass and won the [[1971 U.S. Open - Women's Singles|US Open]] without losing a set, defeating Evert in the semifinals (6–3, 6–2) and Casals in the final.  King then won the tournaments in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], and London (Wembley Pro).  King and Casals both defaulted at 6–6 in the final of the Pepsi Pacific Southwest Open in Los Angeles in September when their request to remove a lineswoman was denied, eventually resulting in the [[United States Lawn Tennis Association]] fining both players US$2,500.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Female tennis stars 'even{{' &quot;}}, ''The Idaho Free Press'', January 5, 1972, page 12&lt;/ref&gt;  To end the year, King played two tournaments in New Zealand but did not win either.  She lost in [[Christchurch]] to Durr and in [[Auckland]] to Kerry Melville Reid.

====1972====
King won three Grand Slam singles titles in 1972, electing not to play the Australian Open despite being nearby when she played in New Zealand in late-1971.  King said, &quot;I was twenty-eight years old, and I was at the height of my powers.  I'm quite sure I could have won the Grand Slam [in] ... 1972, but the Australian was such a minor-league tournament at that time....  More important, I did not want to miss any Virginia Slims winter tournaments.  I was playing enough as it was.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Deford, Frank; King, Billie Jean |title=Billie Jean |publisher=Viking |location=New York, N.Y |year=1982 |pages=20 |isbn=0-670-47843-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the year, King failed to win eight of the first ten tournaments she played.  She won the title in San Francisco in mid-January.  But then King lost in Long Beach to Françoise Durr (although King claimed in her 1982 autobiography that she intentionally lost the match because of an argument with her husband&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Deford, Frank; King, Billie Jean |title=Billie Jean |publisher=Viking |location=New York, N.Y |year=1982 |pages=93 |isbn=0-670-47843-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and in [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]] on [[clay court|clay]] to Chris Evert 6–1, 6–0.  The inconsistent results continued through mid-April, in [[Oklahoma City]] (losing in the quarterfinals); [[Washington, D.C.]] (losing in the second round); and Dallas (losing to Nancy Richey Gunter after defeating Evert in the quarterfinals 6–7(4–5), 6–3, 7–5 and Evonne Goolagong Cawley in the semifinals 1–6, 6–4, 6–1).&lt;ref&gt;For a description of the Dallas tournanment in 1972, see [http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1085895/2/index.htm the ''Sports Illustrated'' article &quot;Shoot-Out at the T Bar M&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;  King won the title in Richmond; however, one week later, King lost in the semifinals of the tournament in San Juan.  This was followed in successive weeks by a loss in the [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]] final to [[:fr:Marie Neumanova Pinterova|Marie Neumannova Pinterova]] and in a St. Petersburg semifinal to Evert (6–2, 6–3).

King did not lose again until mid-August, winning six consecutive tournaments.  She won the tournaments in [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] and Indianapolis.  King then won the French Open without losing a set and completed a career Grand Slam.  She defeated Virginia Wade in the quarterfinals, Helga Niessen Masthoff in the semifinals, and Goolagong Cawley in the final.&lt;ref&gt;After winning the French Open in 1972, King stayed away from the tournament for seven consecutive years and, in fact, played the tournament only twice more during her career, in 1980 and 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;  On grass, King then won the Wimbledon warm-up tournaments in [[Nottingham]] and Bristol and won [[1972 Wimbledon Championships - Women's Singles|Wimbledon]] itself for the fourth time.  She lost only one set during the tournament, to Wade in the quarterfinals.  That was followed by straight set wins over Rosemary Casals and Goolagong Cawley.  When the tour returned to the United States, King did not win any of the three tournaments she played before the [[1972 U.S. Open - Women's Singles|US Open]], including a straight sets loss to Margaret Court in [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]].  At the US Open, however, King won the tournament without losing a set, including a quarterfinal win over Wade, a semifinal defeat of Court, and a final win over Kerry Melville Reid.  King finished the year by winning the tournaments in Charlotte and Phoenix (defeating Court in the final of both), a runner-up finish in [[Oakland]] (losing to Court), and a semifinal finish in [[Boca Raton, Florida|Boca Raton]] (losing to Evert).

====1973====
1973 was Margaret Court's turn to win three Grand Slam singles titles, failing to win only Wimbledon, and was the clear World No. 1 for the year.  As during the previous year, King started 1973 inconsistently.  She missed the first three Virginia Slims tournaments in January because of a wrist injury.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;King bows in, on courts&quot;, ''Daily Review'', [[Hayward, California]], February 8, 1973, page 30&lt;/ref&gt;  She then lost in the third round at the Virginia Slims of [[Miami]] tournament but won the Virginia Slims of Indianapolis tournament, defeating Court in the semifinals 6–7, 7–6, 6–3 and Rosemary Casals in the final.  The semifinal victory ended Court's 12-tournament and 59-match winning streaks,&lt;ref&gt;{{&quot; '}}Sweetie' upset for Billie Jean&quot;, ''Oakland Tribune'', February 26, 1973, page E27&lt;/ref&gt; with King saving at least three match points when down 5–4 (40–0) in the second set.  Indianapolis was followed by five tournaments that King failed to win (Detroit, [[Boston]], Chicago, [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], and the inaugural [[Family Circle Cup]] in [[Hilton Head, South Carolina]]).  King lost to Court in two of those tournaments.  After deciding not to defend her French Open singles title, King won four consecutive tournaments, including her fifth [[1973 Wimbledon Championships - Women's Singles|Wimbledon]] singles title when she defeated Kerry Melville Reid in the quarterfinals, Evonne Goolagong Cawley in the semifinals on her eighth match point,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Evert Shatters Court, Sets Up American Finals&quot;, ''Abilene (Texas) Reporter-News'',  July 5, 1973, page 2-C&lt;/ref&gt; and Chris Evert in the final.  King lost only nine points in the 6–0 bageling of Evert in the first set of their final.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1087561/index.htm A Bloomin' Winner]&lt;/ref&gt;  In none of the preceding tournaments, however, did King play Court.  Their rivalry resumed in the final of the Virginia Slims of [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] tournament, where Court won for the third time in four matches against King in 1973.  (This was the last ever singles match between those players, with Court winning 21 and King 13 of their 34 matches.)  Three weeks later at the [[1973 U.S. Open - Women's Singles|US Open]], King retired from her fourth round match with Julie Heldman while ill&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Starr, Cynthia; King, Billie Jean |title=We Have Come a Long Way: The Story of Women's Tennis |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |year=1988 |pages=144 |isbn=0-07-034625-9 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and suffering from the oppressive heat and humidity.

=====Battle of the Sexes=====
{{Main|Battle of the Sexes (tennis)}}
Despite King's achievements at the world's biggest tennis tournaments, the U.S. public best remembers her for her win over Bobby Riggs in 1973.

Riggs had been a top men's player in the 1930s and 1940s in both the amateur and professional ranks. He won the Wimbledon men's singles title in 1939, and was considered the World No. 1 male tennis player for 1941, 1946, and 1947. He then became a self-described tennis &quot;hustler&quot; who played in promotional challenge matches. In 1973, he took on the role of male [[chauvinist]].  Claiming that the women's game was so inferior to the men's game that even a 55-year-old like himself could beat the current top female players, he challenged and defeated Margaret Court 6–2, 6–1.  King, who previously had rejected challenges from Riggs, then accepted a lucrative financial offer to play him.

Dubbed the Battle of the Sexes, the Riggs-King match was played at the [[Houston Astrodome]] in [[Texas]] on September 20, 1973. The match garnered huge publicity. In front of 30,492 spectators and a worldwide television audience estimated at 50 million people in 37 countries, King beat Riggs 6–4, 6–3, 6–3. The match is considered a very significant event in developing greater recognition and respect for women's tennis.  King said, &quot;I thought it would set us back 50 years if I didn't win that match.  It would ruin the women's [tennis] tour and affect all women's self-esteem.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;ESPN-BillieJean&quot; /&gt;

In recent years, a persistent [[urban legend]] has arisen, particularly on the [[Internet]], that the rules of tennis were modified for the match so that Riggs had only one serve for King's two and that King was allowed to hit into the doubles court area. In fact, the match was played under the normal rules of tennis{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}.

====1974====
King won five of the first seven tournaments she contested in 1974.  She won the Virginia Slims of San Francisco, defeating Nancy Richey Gunter in the semifinals and Chris Evert in the final.  The following week in [[Indian Wells, California]], King again defeated Gunter in the semifinals but lost to Evert in the final.  King then won tournaments in [[Fairfax, Virginia]] and Detroit before losing a semifinal match to Virginia Wade in Chicago.  King won both tournaments she played in March, defeating Gunter in the [[Akron, Ohio]] final and Evert at the [[US Indoors|U.S. Indoor Championships]] final.  [[Olga Morozova]] then upset King in her next two tournaments, at Philadelphia in the final and at [[1974 Wimbledon Championships - Women's Singles|Wimbledon]] in a quarterfinal 7–5, 6–2.  Afterword, King did not play a tour match until the [[1974 U.S. Open - Women's Singles|US Open]], where she won her fourth singles title and third in the last four years.  She defeated Rosemary Casals in a straight sets quarterfinal, avenged in the semifinals her previous year's loss to Julie Heldman, and narrowly defeated Evonne Goolagong Cawley in the final.  King did not reach a tournament final during the remainder of the year, losing to Heldman in an [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]] semifinal, Wade in a Phoenix semifinal, and Goolagong Cawley in a semifinal of the tour-ending [[WTA Tour Championships|Virginia Slims Championships]] in Los Angeles.

====1975====
In 1975, King played singles only half the year, as she retired (temporarily, as it turned out) from tournament singles competition immediately after winning her sixth [[1975 Wimbledon Championships - Women's Singles|Wimbledon]] singles title.

She began the year in San Francisco, defeating Françoise Durr and Virginia Wade before losing to Chris Evert in the final.  The following week, King won the [[Sarasota, Florida]] tournament, defeating Evert in the final 6–3, 6–2.  Evert said immediately after the final, which was her thirteenth career match with King, &quot;I think that's the best that Billie Jean has ever played.  I hit some great shots but they just kept coming back at me.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Billie Jean Dumps Evert at Sarasota&quot;, ''Daily Times-News'', [[Burlington, North Carolina]], January 20, 1975, page 5B&lt;/ref&gt;  Looking back at that match, King said, &quot;I probably played so well because I had to, for the money. Out of frustration comes creativity. Right?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mrs. Billie Jean King!&quot; /&gt;  Two months later, Wade defeated King in the semifinals of the Philadelphia tournament.  At the [[Austin, Texas]] tournament in April, King defeated Evonne Goolagong Cawley 6–1, 6–3 before losing to Evert in the final.  As King was serving for the match at 6–5 in the third set, a disputed line call went in Evert's favor.  King said after the match that she was cheated out of the match and that she had never been angrier about a match.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Cool Chris Edges Angry Billie Jean&quot;, ''Star-News'', [[Pasadena, California]], April 21, 1975, page B-2&lt;/ref&gt;

King played only one of the Wimbledon warm-up tournaments, defeating Olga Morozova in the [[The Hastings Direct International Championships|Eastbourne]] semifinals before losing to Wade in the final.  Seeded third at Wimbledon, King defeated seventh seeded Morozova in the quarterfinals (6–3, 6–3) and then top seeded Evert in the semifinals (2–6, 6–2, 6–3) after being down 3–0 (40–15) in the final set.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deford, Frank; King, Billie Jean 1982 95&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Deford, Frank; King, Billie Jean |title=Billie Jean |publisher=Viking |location=New York, N.Y |year=1982 |pages=95 |isbn=0-670-47843-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Evert blamed her semifinal defeat on a loss of concentration when she saw [[Jimmy Connors]], her former fiance, escorting [[Susan George (actress)|Susan George]] into Centre Court.  King, however, believes that the match turned around because King planned for and totally prepared for Wimbledon that year and told herself when she was on the verge of defeat, &quot;Hey, Billie Jean, this is ridiculous.  You paid the price.  For once, you looked ahead.  You're supposed to win.  Get your bahoola in gear.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Deford, Frank; King, Billie Jean 1982 95&quot; /&gt;  King then defeated fourth seeded Goolagong Cawley in the second most lopsided women's final ever at Wimbledon (6–0, 6–1).  King called her performance a &quot;near perfect match&quot; and said to the news media, &quot;I'm never coming back.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lannin, Joanne |title=Billie Jean King: Tennis Trailblazer |publisher=Lerner Publications Co |location=Minneapolis |year=1999 |pages=99 |isbn=0-8225-4959-X |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The later years: 1976 through 1990===
====1976====
Except for five Federation Cup singles matches that she won in straight sets in August, King played only in doubles and mixed doubles events from January through September.  She partnered [[Phil Dent]] to the mixed doubles title at the US Open.  She lost to [[Dianne Fromholtz Balestrat]] in both of the singles tournaments she played the remainder of the year.  Looking back, King said, &quot;I wasted 1976.  After watching Chris Evert and Evonne [Goolagong] Cawley play the final at [[1976 Wimbledon Championships - Women's Singles|Wimbledon]] I asked myself what I was doing.  So, despite my age and the operations, the Old Lady came back....&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Brace, Reginald; King, Billie Jean |title=Play Better Tennis: With Billie Jean King and Reginald Brace |publisher=Octopus |location= |year=1981 |pages=16 |isbn= 0706412230 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  King had knee surgery for the third time on November 9,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Billie Jean Undergoes Knee Surgery&quot;, ''Tyrone (Pennsylvania) Daily Herald'', November 10, 1976, page 12&lt;/ref&gt; this time on her right knee,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;King Will Resume Singles Competition&quot;, ''The Pocono Record'', [[Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania]], January 20, 1977, page 14&lt;/ref&gt; and did not play the remainder of the year.

====1977====
King spent the first three months of the year rehabilitating her right knee after surgery in November 1976.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;King to Command McFarlin Spotlight&quot;, ''San Antonio Light'', March 21, 1977, page 1-B&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1977, King requested that the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) exercise its right to grant a wild card entry to King for the eight-player Virginia Slims Championships at Madison Square Garden in New York City.  Margaret Court, who finished in sixth place on the Virginia Slims points list, failed to qualify for the tournament because she did not play enough Virginia Slims tournaments leading up to the championships.  This left a spot open in the draw, which the WTA filled with [[Mima Jaušovec]].  King then decided to play the Lionel Cup tournament in [[San Antonio, Texas]], which the WTA harshly criticized because tournament officials there had allowed [[transexual]] [[Renee Richards]] to enter.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Billie Jean King returns to tennis action&quot;, ''The Independent Record'', [[Helena, Montana]], March 23, 1977, page 10.&lt;/ref&gt;  Chris Evert, Martina Navratilova, and [[Betty Stöve]] (president of the WTA) criticized King's decision because of Richards's unresolved and highly controversial status on the women's tennis tour.  Evert said she was disappointed with King and that until Richards's status was resolved, &quot;all of the women should stick together.&quot;  Navratilova said, &quot;Billie Jean is a bad girl pouting.  She made a bad decision.  She's mad because she could not get what she wanted.&quot;  Stöve said that if King had wanted the competition, &quot;[T]here are plenty of men around here she could've played with.  She didn't have to choose a 'disputed' tournament.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Gals Coninue to Snap at King&quot;, ''San Antonio Light'', March 25, 1977, page 4-E&lt;/ref&gt;  The draw in San Antonio called for King to play Richards in the semifinals had form held; however, Richards lost in the quarterfinals.  King eventually won the tournament.

At the [[clay court]] Family Circle Cup in late March, King played for the last time her long-time rival Nancy Richey Gunter in the first round.  King won 0–6, 7–6, 6–2.  She defeated another clay court specialist, [[Virginia Ruzici]], in the second round before winning only one game from Evert in the final.

At [[1977 Wimbledon Championships - Women's Singles|Wimbledon]] in the third round, King played Maria Bueno for the last time, with King winning 6–2, 7–5.  In the quarterfinals, Evert defeated King for the first time at a Grand Slam singles tournament and for the first time on grass 6–1, 6–2 in just 46 minutes.  Evert said it was the best match she had ever played on grass up to that point in her career,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Evert Thrashes Former Queen, King With 6–1, 6–2 Win at Wimbledon&quot;, ''Galveston (Texas) News'', June 28, 1977, page B1&lt;/ref&gt; and King said, &quot;She just played beautiful tennis.  I don't think many players would've beaten her today.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Evert Drops King in Quarter-Finals&quot;, ''Wisconsin State Journal'', June 28, 1977, page 1, section 2&lt;/ref&gt;  King also said after the match, &quot;Maybe I can be happy being number eight instead of number one.  At this stage, just playing, that's winning enough for me.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lannin, Joanne |title=Billie Jean King: Tennis Trailblazer |publisher=Lerner Publications Co |location=Minneapolis |year=1999 |pages=101 |isbn=0-8225-4959-X |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  But when asked about retirement, King said, &quot;Retire?  Quit tournament tennis?  You gotta be kidding.  It just means I've got a lot more work.  I've got to make myself match tough ... mentally as well as physically.  I gotta go out and kill myself for the next six months.  It's a long, arduous process.  I will suffer.  But I will be back.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Tennis' Joe Frazier&quot;, ''Idaho State Journal'', [[Pocatello, Idaho]], June 28, 1977, page A6&lt;/ref&gt;

Evert repeated her Wimbledon quarterfinal victory over King at the clay court [[1977 U.S. Open - Women's Singles|US Open]], winning 6–2, 6–0.  This loss prompted King to say, &quot;I better get it together by October or November or that's it.  I'll have to make some big decisions.  I'm not 20-years-old and I can't just go out and change my game.  It's only the last four weeks I haven't been in [knee] pain.  [But if] I keep using that as a copout, I shouldn't play.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Comeback Soon Over for King?&quot;, ''News Tribune'', [[Fort Pierce, Florida]], September 8, 1977, page 10&lt;/ref&gt;

The remainder of the year, King's win–loss record was 31–3, losing only to Evert, Dianne Fromholtz Balestrat, and [[:fr:Michelle Tyler-Wilson|Michelle Tyler Wilson]].  King won five of the eight tournaments she entered plus both of her Wightman Cup matches.  She defeated Navratilova all four times they played, including three times in three consecutive weeks, and beat Wimbledon champion Virginia Wade twice.  Beginning September 26, King played seven consecutive weeks.  She lost to Tyler in the second round in [[Palm Harbor, Florida]] and Fromholtz Balestrat in the semifinals in [[Atlanta]].  She then won three [[hard court]] tournaments in three consecutive weeks.  She defeated Navratilova and [[Wendy Turnbull]] to win in Phoenix, losing only four points to Turnbull in the third set of the final.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;King Wins 1st Major Tourney in 2 Years&quot;, ''Raleigh Register'', [[Beckley, West Virginia]], October 17, 1977, page 8&lt;/ref&gt;  The next week, she defeated Navratilova, Fromholtz Balestrat, and Wimbledon runner-up Stöve to win in [[São Paulo, Brazil|São Paulo]].  The third week, she defeated Ruzici, Stöve, and [[Janet Newberry|Janet Newberry Wright]] to win in San Juan.  In November, Evert snapped King's 18-match winning streak in the final of the Colgate Series Championships in [[Mission Hills, California]].  King then won her Wightman Cup matches, defeated Navratilova to win the tournament in Japan, and beat Wade to win the Bremar Cup in London.  King said, &quot;I have never had a run like this, even in the years when I was Wimbledon champion.  At 34 I feel fitter than when I was 24.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;King, Wade London Finalists&quot;, ''Star-News'', Pasadena, California, December 11, 1977, page D-7&lt;/ref&gt;

====1978====
King played ten singles tournaments during the first half of 1978, limiting herself to doubles after Wimbledon.

To start the year, King was the runner-up in Houston and [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] (losing to Martina Navratilova in both) and in Philadelphia (losing to Chris Evert).  At the Virginia Slims Championships, King lost her first round robin match to Virginia Wade and defaulted her two remaining round robin matches because of a leg injury sustained during the first match.

At [[1978 Wimbledon Championships - Women's Singles|Wimbledon]], King played with a painful heel spur in her left foot and lost to Evert in the quarterfinals for the second consecutive year 6–3, 3–6, 6–2.  The match was on-serve in the third set with King serving at 2–3 (40–0) before Evert won five consecutive points to break serve.  King won a total of only two points during the last two games.  King said after the match, &quot;I don't think my mobility is very good and that's what I need to beat her.  Physically, she [Evert] tears your guts apart unless you can stay with her. I'm really disappointed.  I really wanted to play well.  I just couldn't cut it because of my heel.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Evert Enters Grudge Match With Wade&quot;, ''Galveston (Texas) Daily News'', July 5, 1978, page 1-B&lt;/ref&gt;

King teamed with Navratilova to win the women's doubles title at the US Open, King's fourth women's doubles title at that tournament and 14th Grand Slam women's doubles title overall.  To end the year, King was undefeated in five doubles matches (four with Evert and one with Rosemary Casals) as the U.S. won the Federation Cup in Melbourne.  During the Federation Cup competition, King hinted at retirement from future major singles competitions and said that she was &quot;sick and tired of continued surgery&quot; in trying to get fit enough for those events.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;U.S. wins Federation Cup opener&quot;, ''European Stars and Stripes'', November 29, 1978, page 28&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, King had foot surgery on December 22 in an attempt to regain mobility for a return to the tennis tour.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Surgery for King&quot;, ''Valley Independent'', [[Monessen, Pennsylvania]], December 22, 1978, page 9&lt;/ref&gt;

====1979====
During the first half of 1979, King played only one event - doubles in the Federation Cup tie against Spain - because of major surgery to her left foot during December 1978.

King returned to singles competition at the Wimbledon warm-up tournament in [[Chichester]].  She defeated the reigning Wimbledon champion, Martina Navratilova, in a 48-minute quarterfinal 6–1, 6–2&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Sports Shorts&quot;, ''The Capital'', [[Annapolis, Maryland]], June 16, 1979, page 25&lt;/ref&gt; before losing to Evonne Goolagong Cawley in the semifinals 1–6, 6–4, 10–8.  Seeded seventh at [[1979 Wimbledon Championships - Women's Singles|Wimbledon]], King defeated [[Hana Mandlíková]] in the fourth round before losing the last six games&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Radosta| first=John S.|author-link=John S.

King partnered with Navratilova at Wimbledon to win King's 20th and final Wimbledon title, breaking [[Elizabeth Ryan]]'s longstanding record of 19 Wimbledon titles just one day after Ryan collapsed and died at Wimbledon.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Ryan dies at Wimbledon&quot;, ''The News'', [[Frederick, Maryland]], July 7, 1979, page D-2&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[1979 U.S. Open - Women's Singles|US Open]], the ninth-seeded King reached the quarterfinals without dropping a set, where she upset the fourth-seeded Virginia Wade 6–3, 7–6(4).  Next up was a semifinal match with the four-time defending champion and top-seeded Chris Evert; however, with King hampered by a neck injury sustained during a bear hug with a friend the day before the match, Evert won 6–1, 6–0, including the last eleven games and 48 of the last 63 points.&lt;ref name = &quot;Amdur-19790908&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|last=Amdur| first=Neil|author-link=Neil Amdur|title=Injured Mrs. King Is Routed By Mrs. Lloyd in Semifinals|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 8, 1979|month=September|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was Evert's eighth consecutive win over King, with Evert during those matches losing only one set and 31 games and winning four 6–0 sets.&lt;ref name = &quot;Amdur-19790908&quot; /&gt;  Evert said after the match, &quot;Psychologically, I feel very confident when I ... play her.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Amdur-19790908&quot; /&gt;

The following week in Tokyo, King won her first singles title in almost two years, defeating Goolagong Cawley in the final.  In November in Stockholm, King defeated Betty Stöve in the final after Stöve lost her concentration while serving for the match at 5–4 in the third set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Brace, Reginald; King, Billie Jean |title=Play Better Tennis: With Billie Jean King and Reginald Brace |publisher=Octopus |location= |year=1981 |pages=46 |isbn= 0706412230 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Three weeks later in [[Brighton]], King lost a semifinal match with Navratilova 7–5, 0–6, 7–6(3) after King led 6–5 in the third set.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Navratilova-Lloyd Final|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 25, 1979|month=November|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She ended the year with a quarterfinal loss in Melbourne (not the Australian Open), a second round loss in Sydney, and a three-set semifinal loss to Austin in Tokyo.

====1980====
King won the tournament in Houston that began in late February, snapping Martina Navratilova's 28-match winning streak in the straight-sets final.&lt;ref&gt;Martina and Billie advance&quot;, ''Daily Press'', [[Escanaba, Michigan]], March 20, 1980, page 3-B&lt;/ref&gt;

At the winter series-ending Avon Championships in March, King defeated Virginia Wade in her first round robin match 6–1, 6–3.  After Wade held serve at love to open the match, King won nine consecutive games and lost only nine points during those games.&lt;ref&gt;Martina and Billie advance&quot;, ''Daily Press'', Escanaba, Michigan, March 20, 1980, page 3-B&lt;/ref&gt;  King then lost her second round robin match to Navratilova and defeated Wendy Turnbull in an elimination round match, before losing to Tracy Austin in the semifinals 6–3, 6–1.

King played the French Open for the first time since she won the event in 1972 and completed a career singles Grand Slam.  She was seeded second but lost in the quarterfinals to fifth-seeded Dianne Fromholtz Balestrat of Australia 6–1, 6–4.

At [[1980 Wimbledon Championships - Women's Singles|Wimbledon]], King defeated [[Pam Shriver]] in a two hour, forty minute fourth round match 5–7, 7–6, 10–8 after King saved a match point in the second set and recovered from a 4–2 (40–0) deficit in the third set with Shriver serving.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;This Is a Wimbly to Remember for Veteran King&quot;, ''Abilene (Texas) Reporter-News'', July 1, 1980, page 1-C&lt;/ref&gt;  In a quarterfinal that took two days to complete, King lost to two-time defending champion and top-seeded Navratilova 7–6, 1–6, 10–8.  The beginning of the match was delayed until late afternoon because of rain.  Because she wore eyeglasses, King agreed to start the match then on condition that tournament officials immediately suspend the match if the rain resumed.  During the first set, drizzle began to fall; however, the chair umpire refused to suspend the match.  King led in the tiebreaker 5–1 before Navratilova came back to win the set, whereupon the umpire then agreed to the suspension.  When the match resumed the next day, King won 20 of the first 23 points to take a 5–0 lead in the second set and lost a total of seven points while winning the set in just 17 minutes.  In the third set, Navratilova broke serve to take a 2–0 lead before King broke back twice and eventually served for the match at 6–5.  King then hit four volley errors, enabling Navratilova to break serve at love and even the match.  King saved three match points while serving at 6–7 and three more match points while serving at 7–8.  During the change-over between games at 8–9, King's eyeglasses broke for the first time in her career.  She had a spare pair, but they did not feel the same.  King saved two match points before Navratilova broke serve to win the match.  King said, &quot;I think that may be the single match in my career that I could have won if I hadn't had bad eyes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Deford, Frank; King, Billie Jean |title=Billie Jean |publisher=Viking |location=New York, N.Y |year=1982 |pages= 82|isbn=0-670-47843-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Navratilova downs veteran King&quot;, ''Daily Intelligencer'', [[Doylestown, Pennsylvania]], July 2, 1980, page 21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Martina Edges King; Borg, Connors Win&quot;, ''Syracuse (New York) Herald-Journal'', July 2, 1980, page C-1&lt;/ref&gt;

King teamed with Navratilova to win King's 39th and final Grand Slam title at the US Open.  Navratilova then decided she wanted a new doubles partner and started playing with Shriver but refused to discuss the change directly with King.  She finally confronted Navratilova during the spring of 1981, reportedly saying to her, &quot;Tell me I'm too old ... but tell me something.&quot;  Navratilova refused to talk about it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lannin, Joanne |title=Billie Jean King: Tennis Trailblazer |publisher=Lerner Publications Co |location=Minneapolis |year=1999 |pages=103 |isbn=0-8225-4959-X |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1982====
In 1982, King was 38 years old and the twelfth-seed at [[1982 Wimbledon Championships - Women's Singles|Wimbledon]].  In her third round match with [[:fr:Tanya Harford|Tanya Harford]] of South Africa, King was down 7–5, 5–4 (40–0) before saving three match points&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,925571-2,00.html Wimbledon Under the Weather]&lt;/ref&gt; to win the second set 7–6(2) and then the third set 6–3.  King said in her post-match press conference, &quot;I can't recall the previous time I have been so close to defeat and won.  When I was down 4–5 and love–40, I told myself, 'You have been here 21 years, so use that experience and hang on.{{' &quot;}}&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, June 27, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;  In the fourth round, King upset sixth-seeded Australian Wendy Turnbull in straight sets.  King then upset third-seeded Tracy Austin in the quarterfinals 3–6, 6–4, 6–2 to became the oldest female semifinalist at Wimbledon since [[Dorothea Lambert Chambers|Dorothea Douglass Lambert Chambers]] in 1920.  This was King's first career victory over Austin after five defeats and reversed the result of their 1979 Wimbledon quarterfinal.  King said in her post-match press conference, &quot;Today, I looked at the scoreboard when I was 2–0 in the third set and the '2' seemed to be getting bigger and bigger.  In 1979, when I was up 2–0 at the same stage, I was tired and didn't have anything left.  But today I felt so much better and was great mentally.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, July 1, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;  Two days later in the semifinals, which was King's 250th career match at Wimbledon in singles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles,&lt;ref&gt;Knight-Ridder Wire, July 3, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; the second-seeded Chris Evert defeated King on her fifth match point 7–6(4), 2–6, 6–3.  King was down a set and 2–1 in the second set before winning five consecutive games to even the match.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, July 3, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;  King explained that she actually lost the match in the first set by failing to convert break points at 15–40 in the second and fourth games.&lt;ref&gt;''Dallas Morning News'', &quot;Lloyd spoils King's hopes&quot;, July 3, 1982, pages 1B, 9B; ''Dallas Times Herald'', &quot;Evert stops King rally in Wimbledon replay&quot;, July 3, 1982, page B-7&lt;/ref&gt;

====1983====
King retired from competitive play in singles at the end of 1983.

She reached the semifinals in her final appearance at [[1983 Wimbledon Championships - Women's Singles|Wimbledon]], losing to [[Andrea Jaeger]] 6–1, 6–1 after beating [[Kathy Jordan]] in the quarterfinals, seventh-seeded Wendy Turnbull in the fourth round, and Rosemary Casals, her longtime doubles partner, in the third round.  Jaeger claims that she was highly motivated to defeat King because King had defeated Turnbull, a favorite of Jaeger's, and because King refused a towel from an attendant just before her match with Jaeger, explaining, &quot;I'm not going to sweat in this match.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/femail/article.html?in_article_id=560743&amp;in_page_id=1879 Why I became a nun, by former tennis star Andrea Jaeger]&lt;/ref&gt;

King became the oldest WTA player to win a singles tournament when won Birmingham at 39 years, 7 months and 23 days. [[Kimiko Date Krumm]], who won 2009's Hansol Korea Open, holds second place with the win having occurred one day before she turned 39. The final official singles match of King's career was a second round 7–6, 4–6, 6–4 loss to [[Catherine Tanvier]] at the [[1983 Australian Open - Women's Singles|1983 Australian Open]].

====1984–1990====
King played doubles sporadically from 1984 through 1990.  She retired from competitive play in doubles in March 1990.  In her last competitive doubles match, King and her partner, [[Jennifer Capriati]], lost a second round match to [[Brenda Schultz-McCarthy]] and [[Andrea Temesvári]] 6–3, 6–2 at the Virginia Slims of Florida tournament.

===Furthering the tennis profession===
Before the start of the [[Tennis Open Era|open era]] in 1968, King earned US$100 a week as a playground instructor and student at [[California State University, Los Angeles|Los Angeles State College]] when not playing in major tennis tournaments.

In 1967, King criticized the United States Lawn Tennis Association (USLTA) in a series of press conferences, denouncing what she called the USLTA's practice of &quot;shamateurism&quot;, where top players were paid under the table to guarantee their entry into tournaments. King argued that this was corrupt and kept the game highly elitist. King quickly became a significant force in the opening of tennis to professionalism.  King said this about the amateur game,

{{quote|In America, tennis players are not people.  If you are in tennis, you are a cross between a panhandler and a visiting in-law.  You're not respected, you're tolerated.

When the open era began, King campaigned for equal prize money in the men's and women's games. As the financial backing of the women's game improved due to the efforts of ''World Tennis'' magazine founder, publisher and editor [[Gladys Heldman]], King became the first woman athlete to earn over US$100,000 in prize money in 1971;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.billiejeanking.com/fact.aspx BJK Firsts and Facts]&lt;/ref&gt; however, inequalities continued.  King won the US Open in 1972 but received US$15,000 less than the men's champion [[Ilie Năstase]]. She stated that she would not play the next year if the prize money were not equal. In 1973, the US Open became the first major tournament to offer equal prize money for men and women.

King led player efforts to support the first professional women's tennis tour in the 1970s called the Virginia Slims, founded by Heldman and funded by Joseph Cullman of [[Philip Morris USA|Philip Morris]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.budcollinstennis.com/buds-notes/notes-gladysh03.html Bud Collins on Gladys Heldman]&lt;/ref&gt; Once the tour took flight, King worked tirelessly to promote it even though many of the other top players were not supportive.  &quot;For three years we had two tours and because of their governments [Martina] Navratilova and Olga Morozova had to play the other tour. Chris [Evert], Margaret [Court], Virginia [Wade], they let us do the pioneering work and they weren't very nice to us. If you go back and look at the old quotes; they played for the love of the game, we played for the money. When we got backing and money, we were all playing together – I wonder why?  I tried not to get upset with them. Forgiveness is important. Our job was to have one voice and win them over.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;TimesOnline-20071209&quot; /&gt;

In 1973, King became the first president of the women's players union – the Women's Tennis Association.  In 1974, she, with husband Larry King and [[Jim Jorgensen]], founded [[WomenSports magazine|''womenSports'']] magazine and started the Women's Sports Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.womenssportsfoundation.org/cgi-bin/iowa/about/article.html?record=86 Billie Jean King: Founder, Leader, Legend]&lt;/ref&gt;  Also in 1974, King helped to found [[World TeamTennis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wtt.com/page.aspx?article_id=64 Billie Jean King co-founder]&lt;/ref&gt;  She became league commissioner in 1982.

King is a member of the Board of Honorary Trustees for the [[Sports Museum of America]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesportsmuseum.com/about_board.html Board of Honorary Trustees]&lt;/ref&gt; which opened in 2008.  The museum is the home of the [[Billie Jean King International Women's Sports Center]], a comprehensive women's sports hall of fame and exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesportsmuseum.com/experience_bjk.html The Billie Jean King Intl Women's Sports Center]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coach of national teams===
In the mid-1990s, King became the captain of the United States Fed Cup team and coach of its women's [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] tennis squad. She guided the U.S. to the Fed Cup championship in 1996 and helped [[Lindsay Davenport]], [[Gigi Fernández]], and [[Mary Joe Fernandez]] capture Olympic gold medals.

In 2002, King dismissed Capriati from the Fed Cup team, saying Capriati had violated rules that forbade bringing along and practicing with personal coaches. Opinion was sharply divided, with many supporting King's decision but many feeling the punishment was too harsh, especially in hindsight when [[Monica Seles]] and [[Lisa Raymond]] were defeated by lower-ranked Austrians [[Barbara Schett]] and [[:fr:Barbara Schwartz|Barbara Schwartz]]. The following year, [[Zina Garrison]] succeeded King as Fed Cup captain.

===Grand Slam singles tournaments===
King's triumph at the French Open in 1972 made her only the fifth woman in tennis history to win the singles titles at all four Grand Slam events, a &quot;career Grand Slam.&quot;  (Four additional women have completed a career Grand Slam since King.)  King also won a career Grand Slam in mixed doubles.  In women's doubles, only the Australian Open eluded her.

King won a record 20 career titles at Wimbledon – 6 singles, 10 women's doubles, and 4 mixed doubles. (Martina Navratilova also has 20 career titles at Wimbledon.)

King played 51 Grand Slam singles events from 1959 through 1983 (197–39 .835 win–loss record): 21 at Wimbledon (96–15 win–loss record), 18 at the U.S. Championships/Open (63–14 win–loss record), 7 at the French Championships/Open (22–6 win–loss record), and 5 at the Australian Championships/Open (16–4 win–loss record).  King reached at least the semifinals in 27 and at least the quarterfinals in 40 out of her 51 attempts.

King was the runner-up in 6 Grand Slam singles events.

An indicator of King's mental toughness at crunch time in Grand Slam singles tournaments was her 11–2 career record in deuce third sets, i.e., third sets that were tied 5–5 before being resolved.

===Singles titles and career prize money===
King won 129 singles titles, and her career prize money totalled US$1,966,487.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sonyericssonwtatour.com/page/Player/Stats/0,,12781~4011,00.html |title=Women's Tennis Association biography of Billie Jean King |accessdate=2009-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Major international team competitions===
====Federation Cup====
In Federation Cup finals, King was on the winning United States team seven times, in 1963, 1966, 1967, and 1976 through 1979.  Her career win–loss record was 52–4 (26–3 in singles and 26–1 in doubles).  She won the last 30 matches she played (excluding two unfinished matches), including 15 straight wins in both singles and doubles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fedcup.com/teams/player.asp?player=20000786 Billie Jean King record in Federation Cup]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wightman Cup====
In Wightman Cup competition, King's career win–loss record was 22–4 (14–2 in singles and 8–2 in doubles), winning her last 9 matches (6 in singles and 3 in doubles).  The United States won the cup 10 of the 11 years that King participated.  In singles, King was 6–1 against Ann Haydon Jones, 4–0 against Virginia Wade, and 1–1 against Christine Truman Janes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hollander, Zander; Collins, Bud |title=Bud Collins' Modern Encyclopedia of Tennis |publisher=Visible Ink Press |location=Detroit, Michigan |year=1994 |pages=580–1 |isbn=081039443X |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards, honors, and tributes==
[[Image:CAHoF Inductees Gov 1st Lady.jpg|thumb|350px|right|The 2006 [[California Hall of Fame]] Inductees with the Governor and First Lady.]]

Margaret Court, who won more Grand Slam titles than anyone, has said that King was &quot;the greatest competitor I’ve ever known&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insidetennis.com/0405_bestfemale.html Who Is the Greatest Female Player Ever?]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chris Evert, winner of 18 Grand Slam singles titles, has said, &quot;She's the wisest human being that I've ever met and has vision people can only dream about.  Billie Jean King is my mentor and has given me advice about my tennis and my boyfriends. On dealing with my parents and even how to raise children. And she doesn't have any.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/sports/other_sports/tennis/articles/2006/12/03/no_royalty_like_king No royalty like King]&lt;/ref&gt;

King was the [[Associated Press]] Female Athlete of the Year in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Billie Jean King Named 'Woman Athlete of the Year{{' &quot;}}, Daily Capital News, [[Jefferson City, Missouri]], January 13, 1968, page 6&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, King became the first tennis player to be named ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' [[Sportsman of the Year]].  She was also the first female athlete ever to receive that honor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/magazine/specials/sportsman/2006/12/04/wade.sportsman/index.html ''Sports Illustrated'' honors Wade]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedynamicpath.com/pages/personalities/sports/billie-jean-king.php The Dynamic Path - Billie Jean King]&lt;/ref&gt;

Friends with singer [[Elton John]], the 1975 song &quot;[[Philadelphia Freedom (song)|Philadelphia Freedom]]&quot; is a tribute to King.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} On a [[PBS]] program, John talked about how he brought a demo copy of the record to play for her right after he had recorded it.

In 1975, ''[[Seventeen (magazine)|Seventeen]]'' magazine found that King was the most admired woman in the world from a poll of its readers. [[Golda Meir]], who had been [[Israel]]'s prime minister until the previous year, finished second.&lt;ref name = &quot;ESPN-BillieJean&quot; /&gt;

In 1979, several top players were asked who they would pick to help them recover from a hypothetical deficit of 1–5 (15–40) in the third set of a match on Wimbledon's [[Centre Court]].  Martina Navratilova, Rosemary Casals, and Françoise Durr all picked King.  Navratilova said, &quot;I would have to pick Billie Jean at her best.  Consistently, Chris [Evert] is hardest to beat but for one big occasion, one big match, one crucial point, yes, it would have to be Billie Jean.&quot;  Casals said, &quot;No matter how far down you got her, you never could be sure of beating her.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Billie Jean King toughest in tight spot: Durr says&quot;, ''Daily Leader'', [[Pontiac, Illinois]], March 22, 1979, page 13&lt;/ref&gt;

King was inducted into the [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]] in 1987.&lt;ref name=&quot;ITHF biography&quot; /&gt;

''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine in 1990 named her one of the &quot;100 Most Important Americans of the 20th Century.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;ESPN-BillieJean&quot; /&gt;

King was the recipient of the 1999 [[Arthur Ashe Courage Award]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://espn.go.com/espy2004/s/04asheaward.html Weah selected for Arthur Ashe Courage Award]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, King received an award from the [[Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation|GLAAD]], an organization devoted to reducing discrimination against gays, lesbians and bisexuals, for &quot;furthering the visibility and inclusion of the community in her work.&quot;  The award noted her involvement in production and the free distribution of educational films, as well as serving on the boards of several [[AIDS]] charities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glaad.org/media/archive_detail.php?id=99 Billie Jean King, Dennis &amp; Judy Shepard, Doonesbury, Harper's and Many Others Honored at the 11th Annual GLAAD Media Awards Presented by ''Absolut Vodka'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the Women's Sports Foundation began to sponsor the [[Billie Awards]], which are named after and hosted by King.

[[Charles M. Schulz]], creator of the ''[[Peanuts]]'' comic strip, was an admirer and close friend.  Schulz referred to King several times in ''Peanuts'' over the years.  In one strip, [[Peppermint Patty]] tells [[Marcie (Peanuts)|Marcie]], &quot;Has anyone ever told you that when you're mad, you look just like Billie Jean King?&quot;

King was awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/President-Obama-Names-Medal-of-Freedom-Recipients/ &quot;President Obama Names Medal of Freedom Recipients&quot;], White House Office of the Press Secretary, July 30, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Mastaba-faraoun-3.jpg|right|thumb|Example of a mastaba]]
A '''mastaba''' is a type of [[Ancient Egypt]]ian [[tomb]] in the form of a flat-roofed, rectangular structure with outward sloping sides that marked the burial site of many eminent Egyptians of Egypt's [[History of Egypt|ancient period]]. Mastabas were constructed out of mud-bricks or stone.

==History==
The greatest stimulus for the ancient Egyptians was their belief in an afterlife. This was reflected in their architecture and most prominently by the enormous amounts of time, money, and manpower involved in the building of their tombs.&lt;ref&gt;Hamlin, Talbot. Architecture through the Ages. New York: Putnam, 1953. p.30.&lt;/ref&gt; “Egyptians believed that the soul could live only if the body was preserved from corruption and depredation.”&lt;ref&gt;Badawy, Alexander. Architecture in Ancient Egypt and the Near East. Cambridge: MIT P, 1966 p.46.&lt;/ref&gt;  From the predynastic era forward, the ancient Egyptians strove to develop methods for preserving the bodies of the dead. Initially embalming methods were used, and later architectural tombs were devised to preserve the corpse indefinitely.&lt;ref&gt;Hamlin, Talbot. Architecture through the Ages. New York: Putnam, 1953. p.30.&lt;/ref&gt; The body would be placed in a deep, sealed chamber such as a Mastaba. Because the remains were not in contact with the dry desert sand, the natural process [[mummy|mummification]] of the remains could not take place. In order to preserve the remains, the ancient Egyptian priests had to devise a system of artificial mummification. &lt;ref&gt;Ancient Egypt and the Near East. Cambridge: MIT P, 1966. p.7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
[[Image:Mastaba.jpg|right|thumb|Structure of a mastaba]]
The word ''Mastaba'' comes from the Arabic word for &quot;bench&quot;, because when seen from a distance it resembles a bench. Inside the mastaba, a deep chamber was dug into the ground and lined with stone or bricks. The exterior building materials were initially bricks made of sun dried mud which was readily available from the [[Nile River]]. Even as more durable materials of stone came into use, the cheaper and easily available mud bricks were used for all but the most important monumental structures.&lt;ref&gt;R., C.L. “A Model of the Mastaba-Tomb of Userkaf-Ankh.” Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin, 8, (1913): 125-130.

The above-ground structure was rectangular in shape, had sloping sides, a flat roof, was about four times as long as it was wide, and rose to at least 30 feet in height. The mastaba was built with a north-south orientation. This above ground structure had space for a small offering chapel equipped with a [[false door]] to which priests and family members brought food and other offerings for the soul of the deceased. A second hidden chamber called a &quot;serdab&quot;, from the [[Arabic]] word for “cellar,” housed a statue of the deceased that was hidden within the masonry for its protection. High up the walls of the serdab were small openings. These openings “were not meant for viewing the statue but rather for allowing the fragrance of burning incense, and possibly the spells spoken in rituals, to reach the statue.”&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Dorothea. When the Pyramids were Built: Egyptian Art of the Old Kingdom. New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1999. p.12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mastaba was the standard type of tomb in pre-dynastic and early dynastic Egypt for both the [[pharaoh]] and the social elite. The ancient Egyptian city of [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]] was the location chosen for many of these early mastabas. 

Even after pharaohs began to construct pyramids for their tombs, members of the nobility continued to be buried in mastaba tombs. This is especially evident on the Giza Plateau, where hundreds of mastaba tombs have been constructed alongside the pyramids.

In the Fourth Dynasty, rock-cut tombs began to appear.  These were tombs built into the rock cliffs in Upper Egypt in an attempt to further thwart grave robbers.&lt;ref&gt;R., L.E. “Two Mastaba Chambers.” Museum of Fine Arts Bulletin, 8.45, (1910): 19-20.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Secretsharing-3-point.png|thumb|right|A linear system in three variables determines a collection of [[plane (mathematics)|planes]]. The intersection point is the solution.]]
In [[mathematics]], a '''system of linear equations''' (or '''linear system''') is a collection of [[linear equation]]s involving the same set of [[variable (math)|variable]]s. For example,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{alignat}{7}
3x &amp;&amp;\; + \;&amp;&amp; 2y             &amp;&amp;\; - \;&amp;&amp; z  &amp;&amp;\; = \;&amp;&amp; 1 &amp; \\
2x &amp;&amp;\; - \;&amp;&amp; 2y             &amp;&amp;\; + \;&amp;&amp; 4z &amp;&amp;\; = \;&amp;&amp; -2 &amp; \\
-x &amp;&amp;\; + \;&amp;&amp; \tfrac{1}{2} y &amp;&amp;\; - \;&amp;&amp; z  &amp;&amp;\; = \;&amp;&amp; 0 &amp;
\end{alignat}&lt;/math&gt;
is a system of three equations in the three variables &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;. A '''solution''' to a linear system is an assignment of numbers to the variables such that all the equations are simultaneously satisfied. A [[Equation solving|solution]] to the system above is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{alignat}{2}
x &amp; = &amp; 1 \\
y &amp; = &amp; -2 \\
z &amp; = &amp; -2
\end{alignat}&lt;/math&gt;
since it makes all three equations valid.&lt;ref&gt;Linear algebra, as discussed in this article, is a very well-established mathematical discipline for which there are many sources. Almost all of the material in this article can be found in Lay 2005, Meyer 2001, and Strang 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In mathematics, the theory of linear systems is a branch of [[linear algebra]], a subject which is fundamental to modern mathematics. Computational [[algorithm]]s for finding the solutions are an important part of [[numerical linear algebra]], and such methods play a prominent role in [[engineering]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[computer science]], and [[economics]]. A system of non-linear equations can often be [[approximation|approximated]] by a linear system (see [[linearization]]), a helpful technique when making a [[mathematical model]] or [[computer simulation]] of a relatively complex system.

==Elementary example==
The simplest kind of linear system involves two equations and two variables:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{alignat}{5}
2x &amp;&amp;\; + \;&amp;&amp; 3y &amp;&amp;\; = \;&amp;&amp; 6 &amp; \\
4x &amp;&amp;\; + \;&amp;&amp; 9y &amp;&amp;\; = \;&amp;&amp; 15&amp;.
\end{alignat}&lt;/math&gt;
One method for solving such a system is as follows. First, solve the top equation for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in terms of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;x = 3 - \frac{3}{2}y.&lt;/math&gt;
Now substitute this expression for ''x'' into the bottom equation:
:&lt;math&gt;4\left( 3 - \frac{3}{2}y \right) + 9y = 15.&lt;/math&gt;
This results in a single equation involving only the variable &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. Solving gives &lt;math&gt;y = 1&lt;/math&gt;, and substituting this back into the equation for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; yields &lt;math&gt;x = 3/2&lt;/math&gt;. This method generalizes to systems with additional variables (see &quot;elimination of variables&quot; below, or the article on [[elementary algebra]].)

==General form==
A general system of ''m'' linear equations with ''n'' unknowns can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{alignat}{7}
a_{11} x_1 &amp;&amp;\; + \;&amp;&amp; a_{12} x_2   &amp;&amp;\; + \cdots + \;&amp;&amp; a_{1n} x_n &amp;&amp;\; = \;&amp;&amp;&amp; b_1 \\
a_{21} x_1 &amp;&amp;\; + \;&amp;&amp; a_{22} x_2   &amp;&amp;\; + \cdots + \;&amp;&amp; a_{2n} x_n &amp;&amp;\; = \;&amp;&amp;&amp; b_2 \\
\vdots\;\;\; &amp;&amp;     &amp;&amp; \vdots\;\;\; &amp;&amp;                &amp;&amp; \vdots\;\;\; &amp;&amp;     &amp;&amp;&amp; \;\vdots \\
a_{m1} x_1 &amp;&amp;\; + \;&amp;&amp; a_{m2} x_2   &amp;&amp;\; + \cdots + \;&amp;&amp; a_{mn} x_n &amp;&amp;\; = \;&amp;&amp;&amp; b_m. \\
\end{alignat}&lt;/math&gt;
Here &lt;math&gt;x_1,\ x_2,...,x_n&lt;/math&gt; are the unknowns, &lt;math&gt;a_{11},\ a_{12},...,\ a_{mn}&lt;/math&gt; are the coefficients of the system, and &lt;math&gt;b_1,\ b_2,...,b_m&lt;/math&gt; are the constant terms.

Often the coefficients and unknowns are [[real number|real]] or [[complex number]]s, but [[integer]]s and [[rational number]]s are also seen, as are polynomials and elements of an abstract [[algebraic structure]].

===Vector equation===
One extremely helpful view is that each unknown is a weight for a [[column vector]] in a [[linear combination]].
:&lt;math&gt;
 x_1 \begin{bmatrix}a_{11}\\a_{21}\\ \vdots \\a_{m1}\end{bmatrix} +
 x_2 \begin{bmatrix}a_{12}\\a_{22}\\ \vdots \\a_{m2}\end{bmatrix} +
 \cdots +
 x_n \begin{bmatrix}a_{1n}\\a_{2n}\\ \vdots \\a_{mn}\end{bmatrix}
 =
 \begin{bmatrix}b_1\\b_2\\ \vdots \\b_m\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
This allows all the language and theory of ''[[vector space]]s'' (or more generally, ''[[module (mathematics)|module]]s'') to be brought to bear. For example, the collection of all possible linear combinations of the vectors on the left-hand side is called their ''[[span (linear algebra)|span]]'', and the equations have a solution just when the right-hand vector is within that span. If every vector within that span has exactly one expression as a linear combination of the given left-hand vectors, then any solution is unique. In any event, the span has a ''[[basis (linear algebra)|basis]]'' of [[linearly independent]] vectors that do guarantee exactly one expression; and the number of vectors in that basis (its ''[[dimension (linear algebra)|dimension]]'') cannot be larger than ''m'' or ''n'', but it can be smaller. This is important because if we have ''m'' independent vectors a solution is guaranteed regardless of the right-hand side, and otherwise not guaranteed.

===Matrix equation===
The vector equation is equivalent to a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] equation of the form
:&lt;math&gt;A\bold{x}=\bold{b}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''A'' is an ''m''×''n'' matrix, '''x''' is a [[column vector]] with ''n'' entries, and '''b''' is a column vector with ''m'' entries.
: &lt;math&gt;
A=
\begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} &amp; a_{12} &amp; \cdots &amp; a_{1n} \\
a_{21} &amp; a_{22} &amp; \cdots &amp; a_{2n} \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
a_{m1} &amp; a_{m2} &amp; \cdots &amp; a_{mn}
\end{bmatrix},\quad
\bold{x}=
\begin{bmatrix}
x_1 \\
x_2 \\
\vdots \\
x_n
\end{bmatrix},\quad
\bold{b}=
\begin{bmatrix}
b_1 \\
b_2 \\
\vdots \\
b_m
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
The number of vectors in a basis for the span is now expressed as the ''[[rank (linear algebra)|rank]]'' of the matrix.

==Solution set==
[[Image:Intersecting Lines.svg|thumb|right|The solution set for the equations {{nowrap|''x'' &amp;minus; ''y'' {{=}} &amp;minus;1}} and {{nowrap|3''x'' + ''y'' {{=}} 9}} is the single point (2,&amp;nbsp;3).]]
A '''solution''' of a linear system is an assignment of values to the variables {{nowrap|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} such that each of the equations is satisfied. The [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of all possible solutions is called the '''[[solution set]]'''.

A linear system may behave in any one of three possible ways:
# The system has ''infinitely many solutions''.
# The system has a single ''unique solution''.
# The system has ''no solution''.

===Geometric interpretation===
For a system involving two variables (''x'' and ''y''), each linear equation determines a [[line (mathematics)|line]] on the ''xy''-[[Cartesian coordinate system|plane]]. Because a solution to a linear system must satisfy all of the equations, the solution set is the [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of these lines, and is hence either a line, a single point, or the [[empty set]].

For three variables, each linear equation determines a [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] in [[three-dimensional space]], and the solution set is the intersection of these planes. Thus the solution set may be a plane, a line, a single point, or the empty set.

For ''n'' variables, each linear equations determines a [[hyperplane]] in [[n-dimensional space|''n''-dimensional space]]. The solution set is the intersection of these hyperplanes, which may be a [[flat (geometry)|flat]] of any dimension.

===General behavior===
[[Image:IntersectingPlanes.png|thumb|right|The solution set for two equations in three variables is usually a line.]]
In general, the behavior of a linear system is determined by the relationship between the number of equations and the number of unknowns:
# Usually, a system with fewer equations than unknowns has infinitely many solutions or sometimes unique sparse solutions ([[Compressed sensing|Compressed Sensing]]). Such a system is also known as an [[underdetermined system]]. 
# Usually, a system with the same number of equations and unknowns has a single unique solution.
# Usually, a system with more equations than unknowns has no solution. Such a system is also known as an [[overdetermined system]].
In the first case, the [[dimension]] of the solution set is usually equal to {{nowrap|''n'' &amp;minus; ''m''}}, where ''n'' is the number of variables and ''m'' is the number of equations.

The following pictures illustrate this trichotomy in the case of two variables:
:{| border=0 cellpadding=5
|-
|width=&quot;150px&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;| [[Image:One Line.svg|120px]]
|width=&quot;150px&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;| [[Image:Two Lines.svg|120px]]
|width=&quot;150px&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;| [[Image:Three Lines.svg|120px]]
|-
|align=&quot;center&quot;| One Equation
|align=&quot;center&quot;| Two Equations
|align=&quot;center&quot;| Three Equations
|}
The first system has infinitely many solutions, namely all of the points on the blue line. The second system has a single unique solution, namely the intersection of the two lines. The third system has no solutions, since the three lines share no common point.

Keep in mind that the pictures above show only the most common case. It is possible for a system of two equations and two unknowns to have no solution (if the two lines are parallel), or for a system of three equations and two unknowns to be solvable (if the three lines intersect at a single point). In general, a system of linear equations may behave differently than expected if the equations are '''[[linear independence|linearly dependent]]''', or if two or more of the equations are '''inconsistent'''.

==Properties==
===Independence===
The equations of a linear system are '''independent''' if none of the equations can be derived algebraically from the others. When the equations are independent, each equation contains new information about the variables, and removing any of the equations increases the size of the solution set. For linear equations, logical independence is the same as [[linear independence]].

[[Image:Three Intersecting Lines.svg|thumb|right|The equations {{nowrap|''x'' &amp;minus; 2''y'' {{=}} &amp;minus;1}}, {{nowrap|3''x'' + 5''y'' {{=}} 8}}, and {{nowrap|4''x'' + 3''y'' {{=}} 7}} are not linearly independent.]]
For example, the equations
:&lt;math&gt;3x+2y=6\;\;\;\;\text{and}\;\;\;\;6x+4y=12&lt;/math&gt;
are not independent — they are the same equation when scaled by a factor of two, and they would produce identical graphs. This is an example of equivalence in a system of linear equations.

For a more complicated example, the equations
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{alignat}{5}
 x &amp;&amp;\; - \;&amp;&amp; 2y &amp;&amp;\; = \;&amp;&amp; -1 &amp; \\
 3x &amp;&amp;\; + \;&amp;&amp; 5y &amp;&amp;\; = \;&amp;&amp; 8 &amp; \\
 4x &amp;&amp;\; + \;&amp;&amp; 3y &amp;&amp;\; = \;&amp;&amp; 7 &amp;
\end{alignat}&lt;/math&gt;
are not independent, because the third equation is the sum of the other two. Indeed, any one of these equations can be derived from the other two, and any one of the equations can be removed without affecting the solution set. The graphs of these equations are three lines that intersect at a single point.

===Consistency===
[[Image:Parallel Lines.svg|thumb|right|The equations {{nowrap|3''x'' + 2''y'' {{=}} 6}} and {{nowrap|3''x'' + 2''y'' {{=}} 12}} are inconsistent.]]
The equations of a linear system are '''consistent''' if they possess a common solution, and '''inconsistent''' otherwise. When the equations are inconsistent, it is possible to derive a [[contradiction]] from the equations, such as the statement that {{nowrap|1 {{=}} 3}}.

For example, the equations
:&lt;math&gt;3x+2y=6\;\;\;\;\text{and}\;\;\;\;3x+2y=12&lt;/math&gt;
are inconsistent. In attempting to find a solution, we tacitly assume that there '''is''' a solution; that is, we assume that the value of ''x'' in the first equation must be the same as the value of ''x'' in the second equation (the same is assumed to simultaneously be true for the value of ''y'' in both equations). Applying the substitution property (for 3x+2y) yields the equation {{nowrap|6 {{=}} 12}}, which is a false statement. This therefore contradicts our assumption that the system had a solution and we conclude that our assumption was false; that is, the system in fact has '''no solution'''. The graphs of these equations on the ''xy''-plane are a pair of [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] lines.

It is possible for three linear equations to be inconsistent, even though any two of the equations are consistent together. For example, the equations
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{alignat}{7}
 x &amp;&amp;\; + \;&amp;&amp; y &amp;&amp;\; = \;&amp;&amp; 1 &amp; \\
2x &amp;&amp;\; + \;&amp;&amp; y &amp;&amp;\; = \;&amp;&amp; 1 &amp; \\
3x &amp;&amp;\; + \;&amp;&amp; 2y &amp;&amp;\; = \;&amp;&amp; 3 &amp;
\end{alignat}&lt;/math&gt;
are inconsistent. Adding the first two equations together gives {{nowrap|3''x'' + 2''y'' {{=}} 2}}, which can be subtracted from the third equation to yield {{nowrap|0 {{=}} 1}}. Note that any two of these equations have a common solution. The same phenomenon can occur for any number of equations.

In general, inconsistencies occur if the left-hand sides of the equations in a system are linearly dependent, and the constant terms do not satisfy the dependence relation. A system of equations whose left-hand sides are linearly independent is always consistent.

===Equivalence===
Two linear systems using the same set of variables are '''equivalent''' if each of the equations in the second system can be derived algebraically from the equations in the first system, and vice-versa. Equivalent systems convey precisely the same information about the values of the variables. In particular, two linear systems are equivalent if and only if they have the same solution set.

==Solving a linear system==
There are several [[algorithm]]s for [[equation solving|solving]] a system of linear equations.

===Describing the solution===
When the solution set is finite, it is usually described in set notation. For example, the solution set 2, 3, and 4 would be written:
&lt;math&gt; \{2,3,4\} &lt;/math&gt;

It can be difficult to describe a set with infinite solutions. Typically, some of the variables are designated as '''free''' (or '''independent''', or as '''parameters'''), meaning that they are allowed to take any value, while the remaining variables are '''dependent''' on the values of the free variables.

For example, consider the following system:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{alignat}{7}
 x &amp;&amp;\; + \;&amp;&amp; 3y &amp;&amp;\; - \;&amp;&amp; 2z &amp;&amp;\; = \;&amp;&amp; 5 &amp; \\
3x &amp;&amp;\; + \;&amp;&amp; 5y &amp;&amp;\; + \;&amp;&amp; 6z &amp;&amp;\; = \;&amp;&amp; 7 &amp;
\end{alignat}&lt;/math&gt;
The solution set to this system can be described by the following equations:
:&lt;math&gt;x=-7z-1\;\;\;\;\text{and}\;\;\;\;y=3z+2\text{.}&lt;/math&gt;
Here ''z'' is the free variable, while ''x'' and ''y'' are dependent on ''z''. Any point in the solution set can be obtained by first choosing a value for ''z'', and then computing the corresponding values for ''x'' and ''y''.

Each free variable gives the solution space one [[Degrees of freedom (statistics)|degree of freedom]], the number of which is equal to the [[dimension]] of the solution set. For example, the solution set for the above equation is a line, since a point in the solution set can be chosen by specifying the value of the parameter ''z''. An infinite solution of higher order may describe a plane, or higher dimensional set.

Different choices for the free variables may lead to different descriptions of the same solution set. For example, the solution to the above equations can alternatively be described as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;y=-\frac{3}{7}x + \frac{11}{7}\;\;\;\;\text{and}\;\;\;\;z=-\frac{1}{7}x-\frac{1}{7}\text{.}&lt;/math&gt;
Here ''x'' is the free variable, and ''y'' and ''z'' are dependent.

===Elimination of variables===
The simplest method for solving a system of linear equations is to repeatedly eliminate variables. This method can be described as follows:
# In the first equation, solve for the one of the variables in terms of the others.
# Plug this expression into the remaining equations. This yields a system of equations with one fewer equation and one fewer unknown.
# Continue until you have reduced the system to a single linear equation.
# Solve this equation, and then back-substitute until the entire solution is found.

For example, consider the following system:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{alignat}{7}
 x &amp;&amp;\; + \;&amp;&amp; 3y &amp;&amp;\; - \;&amp;&amp; 2z &amp;&amp;\; = \;&amp;&amp; 5 &amp; \\
3x &amp;&amp;\; + \;&amp;&amp; 5y &amp;&amp;\; + \;&amp;&amp; 6z &amp;&amp;\; = \;&amp;&amp; 7 &amp; \\
2x &amp;&amp;\; + \;&amp;&amp; 4y &amp;&amp;\; + \;&amp;&amp; 3z &amp;&amp;\; = \;&amp;&amp; 8 &amp;
\end{alignat}&lt;/math&gt;
Solving the first equation for ''x'' gives {{nowrap|''x'' {{=}} 5 + 2''z'' &amp;minus; 3''y''}}, and plugging this into the second and third equation yields
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{alignat}{5}
-4y &amp;&amp;\; + \;&amp;&amp; 12z &amp;&amp;\; = \;&amp;&amp; -8 &amp; \\
-2y &amp;&amp;\; + \;&amp;&amp; 7z &amp;&amp;\; = \;&amp;&amp; -2 &amp;
\end{alignat}&lt;/math&gt;
Solving the first of these equations for ''y'' yields {{nowrap|''y'' {{=}} 2 + 3''z''}}, and plugging this into the second equation yields {{nowrap|''z'' {{=}} 2}}. We now have:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{alignat}{7}
 x &amp;&amp;\; = \;&amp;&amp; 5 &amp;&amp;\; + \;&amp;&amp; 2z &amp;&amp;\; - \;&amp;&amp; 3y &amp; \\
 y &amp;&amp;\; = \;&amp;&amp; 2 &amp;&amp;\; + \;&amp;&amp; 3z &amp;&amp; &amp;&amp; &amp; \\
 z &amp;&amp;\; = \;&amp;&amp; 2 &amp;&amp; &amp;&amp; &amp;&amp; &amp;&amp; &amp;
\end{alignat}&lt;/math&gt;
Substituting {{nowrap|''z'' {{=}} 2}} into the second equation gives {{nowrap|''y'' {{=}} 8}}, and substituting {{nowrap|''z'' {{=}} 2}} and {{nowrap|''y'' {{=}} 8}} into the first equation yields {{nowrap|''x'' {{=}} &amp;minus;15}}. Therefore, the solution set is the single point {{nowrap|(''x'', ''y'', ''z'') {{=}} (&amp;minus;15, 8, 2)}}.

===Row reduction===
{{main|Gaussian elimination}}
In '''row reduction''', the linear system is represented as an [[augmented matrix]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\left[\begin{array}{rrr|r}
1 &amp; 3 &amp; -2 &amp; 5 \\
3 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 &amp; 7 \\
2 &amp; 4 &amp; 3 &amp; 8
\end{array}\right]\text{.}
&lt;/math&gt;
This matrix is then modified using [[elementary row operations]] until it reaches [[reduced row echelon form]]. There are three types of elementary row operations:
:'''Type 1''': Swap the positions of two rows.
:'''Type 2''': Multiply a row by a nonzero [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]].
:'''Type 3''': Add to one row a scalar multiple of another.
Because these operations are reversible, the augmented matrix produced always represents a linear system that is equivalent to the original.

There are several specific algorithms to row-reduce an augmented matrix, the simplest of which are [[Gaussian elimination]] and [[Gauss-Jordan elimination]]. The following computation shows Gauss-Jordan elimination applied to the matrix above:
:&lt;math&gt;\left[\begin{array}{rrr|r}
1 &amp; 3 &amp; -2 &amp; 5 \\
3 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 &amp; 7 \\
2 &amp; 4 &amp; 3 &amp; 8
\end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;\sim
\left[\begin{array}{rrr|r}
1 &amp; 3 &amp; -2 &amp; 5 \\
0 &amp; -4 &amp; 12 &amp; -8 \\
2 &amp; 4 &amp; 3 &amp; 8
\end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;\sim
\left[\begin{array}{rrr|r}
1 &amp; 3 &amp; -2 &amp; 5 \\
0 &amp; -4 &amp; 12 &amp; -8 \\
0 &amp; -2 &amp; 7 &amp; -2
\end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;\sim
\left[\begin{array}{rrr|r}
1 &amp; 3 &amp; -2 &amp; 5 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; -3 &amp; 2 \\
0 &amp; -2 &amp; 7 &amp; -2
\end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;\sim
\left[\begin{array}{rrr|r}
1 &amp; 3 &amp; -2 &amp; 5 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; -3 &amp; 2 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2
\end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;\sim
\left[\begin{array}{rrr|r}
1 &amp; 3 &amp; -2 &amp; 5 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 8 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2
\end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;\sim
\left[\begin{array}{rrr|r}
1 &amp; 3 &amp; 0 &amp; 9 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 8 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2
\end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;\sim
\left[\begin{array}{rrr|r}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -15 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 8 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2
\end{array}\right].&lt;/math&gt;
The last matrix is in reduced row echelon form, and represents the system {{nowrap|''x'' {{=}} &amp;minus;15}}, {{nowrap|''y'' {{=}} 8}}, {{nowrap|''z'' {{=}} 2}}. A comparison with the example in the previous section on the algebraic elimination of variables shows that these two methods are in fact the same; the difference lies in how the computations are written down.

===Cramer's rule===
{{main|Cramer's rule}}
'''Cramer's rule''' is an explicit formula for the solution of a system of linear equations, with each variable given by a quotient of two [[determinant]]s. For example, the solution to the system
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{alignat}{7}
 x &amp;&amp;\; + \;&amp;&amp; 3y &amp;&amp;\; - \;&amp;&amp; 2z &amp;&amp;\; = \;&amp;&amp; 5 &amp; \\
3x &amp;&amp;\; + \;&amp;&amp; 5y &amp;&amp;\; + \;&amp;&amp; 6z &amp;&amp;\; = \;&amp;&amp; 7 &amp; \\
2x &amp;&amp;\; + \;&amp;&amp; 4y &amp;&amp;\; + \;&amp;&amp; 3z &amp;&amp;\; = \;&amp;&amp; 8 &amp;
\end{alignat}&lt;/math&gt;
is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
x=\frac
{\,\left| \begin{matrix}5&amp;3&amp;-2\\7&amp;5&amp;6\\8&amp;4&amp;3\end{matrix} \right|\,}
{\,\left| \begin{matrix}1&amp;3&amp;-2\\3&amp;5&amp;6\\2&amp;4&amp;3\end{matrix} \right|\,}
,\;\;\;\;y=\frac
{\,\left| \begin{matrix}1&amp;5&amp;-2\\3&amp;7&amp;6\\2&amp;8&amp;3\end{matrix} \right|\,}
{\,\left| \begin{matrix}1&amp;3&amp;-2\\3&amp;5&amp;6\\2&amp;4&amp;3\end{matrix} \right|\,}
,\;\;\;\;z=\frac
{\,\left| \begin{matrix}1&amp;3&amp;5\\3&amp;5&amp;7\\2&amp;4&amp;8\end{matrix} \right|\,}
{\,\left| \begin{matrix}1&amp;3&amp;-2\\3&amp;5&amp;6\\2&amp;4&amp;3\end{matrix} \right|\,}.
&lt;/math&gt;
For each variable, the denominator is the determinant of the matrix of coefficients, while the numerator is the determinant of a matrix in which one column has been replaced by the vector of constant terms.

Though Cramer's rule is important theoretically, it has little practical value for large matrices, since the computation of large determinants is somewhat cumbersome. (Indeed, large determinants are most easily computed using row reduction.)
Further, Cramer's rule has very poor numerical properties, making it unsuitable for solving even small systems reliably, unless the operations are performed in rational arithmetic with unbounded precision.

===Other methods===
While systems of three or four equations can be readily solved by hand, computers are often used for larger systems. The standard algorithm for solving a system of linear equations is based on Gaussian elimination with some modifications. Firstly, it is essential to avoid division by small numbers, which may lead to inaccurate results. This can be done by reordering the equations if necessary, a process known as ''pivoting''. Secondly, the algorithm does not exactly do Gaussian elimination, but it computes the [[LU decomposition]] of the matrix ''A''. This is mostly an organizational tool, but it is much quicker if one has to solve several systems with the same matrix ''A'' but different vectors '''b'''.

If the matrix ''A'' has some special structure, this can be exploited to obtain faster or more accurate algorithms. For instance, systems with a [[symmetric matrix|symmetric]] [[positive-definite matrix|positive definite]] matrix can be solved twice as fast with the [[Cholesky decomposition]]. [[Levinson recursion]] is a fast method for [[Toeplitz matrix|Toeplitz matrices]]. Special methods exist also for matrices with many zero elements (so-called [[sparse matrix|sparse matrices]]), which appear often in applications.

A completely different approach is often taken for very large systems, which would otherwise take too much time or memory. The idea is to start with an initial approximation to the solution (which does not have to be accurate at all), and to change this approximation in several steps to bring it closer to the true solution. Once the approximation is sufficiently accurate, this is taken to be the solution to the system. This leads to the class of [[iterative method]]s.

==Homogeneous systems==
A system of linear equations is '''homogeneous''' if all of the constant terms are zero:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{alignat}{7}
a_{11} x_1 &amp;&amp;\; + \;&amp;&amp; a_{12} x_2 &amp;&amp;\; + \cdots + \;&amp;&amp; a_{1n} x_n &amp;&amp;\; = \;&amp;&amp;&amp; 0 \\
a_{21} x_1 &amp;&amp;\; + \;&amp;&amp; a_{22} x_2 &amp;&amp;\; + \cdots + \;&amp;&amp; a_{2n} x_n &amp;&amp;\; = \;&amp;&amp;&amp; 0 \\
\vdots\;\;\; &amp;&amp;     &amp;&amp; \vdots\;\;\; &amp;&amp;              &amp;&amp; \vdots\;\;\; &amp;&amp;     &amp;&amp;&amp; \,\vdots \\
a_{m1} x_1 &amp;&amp;\; + \;&amp;&amp; a_{m2} x_2 &amp;&amp;\; + \cdots + \;&amp;&amp; a_{mn} x_n &amp;&amp;\; = \;&amp;&amp;&amp; 0. \\
\end{alignat}&lt;/math&gt;
A homogeneous system is equivalent to a matrix equation of the form
:&lt;math&gt;A\textbf{x}=\textbf{0}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''A'' is an {{nowrap|''m'' &amp;times; ''n''}} matrix, '''x''' is a column vector with ''n'' entries, and '''0''' is the [[zero vector]] with ''m'' entries.

===Solution set===
Every homogeneous system has at least one solution, known as the '''zero solution''' (or '''trivial solution'''), which is obtained by assigning the value of zero to each of the variables. The solution set has the following additional properties:
# If '''u''' and '''v''' are two [[vector (mathematics)|vectors]] representing solutions to a homogeneous system, then the vector sum {{nowrap|'''u''' + '''v'''}} is also a solution to the system.
# If '''u''' is a vector representing a solution to a homogeneous system, and ''r'' is any [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]], then ''r'''''u''' is also a solution to the system.
These are exactly the properties required for the solution set to be a [[Euclidean subspace|linear subspace]] of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. In particular, the solution set to a homogeneous system is the same as the [[Kernel (matrix)|null space]] of the corresponding matrix ''A''.

===Relation to nonhomogeneous systems===
There is a close relationship between the solutions to a linear system and the solutions to the corresponding homogeneous system:
:&lt;math&gt;A\textbf{x}=\textbf{b}\qquad \text{and}\qquad A\textbf{x}=\textbf{0}\text{.}&lt;/math&gt;
Specifically, if '''p''' is any specific solution to the linear system {{nowrap|''A'''''x''' {{=}} '''b'''}}, then the entire solution set can be described as
:&lt;math&gt;\left\{ \textbf{p}+\textbf{v} : \textbf{v}\text{ is any solution to }A\textbf{x}=\textbf{0} \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;
Geometrically, this says that the solution set for {{nowrap|''A'''''x''' {{=}} '''b'''}} is a [[translation (geometry)|translation]] of the solution set for {{nowrap|''A'''''x''' {{=}} '''0'''}}. Specifically, the [[flat (geometry)|flat]] for the first system can be obtained by translating the [[Euclidean subspace|linear subspace]] for the homogeneous system by the vector '''p'''.

This reasoning only applies if the system {{nowrap|''A'''''x''' {{=}} '''b'''}} has at least one solution. This occurs if and only if the vector '''b''' lies in the [[image (mathematics)|image]] of the [[linear transformation]] ''A''.

The '''Pyramid of Djoser (Zoser)''', or '''step pyramid''' (''kbhw-ntrw'' in [[Ancient Egyptian language|Egyptian]]) is an archeological remain in the [[Saqqara]] necropolis, [[Egypt]], northwest of the city of [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]]. It was built for the burial of [[Pharaoh]] [[Djoser]] by his [[vizier]] [[Imhotep]], during the [[27th century BC]]. It is the central feature of a vast [[mortuary]] complex in an enormous [[courtyard]] surrounded by ceremonial structures and decoration.
 	
This first [[Egyptian pyramid]] consisted of six [[mastaba]]s (of decreasing size) built atop one another in what were clearly revisions and developments of the original plan. The pyramid originally stood {{Convert|62|m|ft|0}} tall, with a base of {{Convert|109|x|125|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and was clad in polished white limestone.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Adès ''A Traveller's History of Egypt'' (Chastleton Travel/Interlink, 2007) ISBN 1-905214-01-4 p48&lt;/ref&gt; The [[step pyramid]] (or proto-pyramid) is considered to be the earliest large-scale cut stone construction, although the nearby enclosure known as [[Gisr el-mudir]] would seem to predate the complex. The oldest known uncut stone pyramid structure dates to 3000 BC in the city of [[Caral]], [[Peru]]. &lt;ref&gt;http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1269&lt;/ref&gt;

==Djoser==
[[Djoser]] was the first or second king of the 3rd Dynasty (ca. 2667 to 2648 BC) of the Egyptian Old Kingdom (ca. 2686 to 2125 BC).&lt;ref name=&quot;Shaw 480&quot;/&gt; He is believed to have ruled for 19 years or, if the 19 years were biennial taxation years, 38 years[6]. He reigned long enough to allow the grandiose plan for his pyramid to be realized in his lifetime&lt;ref name=&quot;Kathryn A. Bard 2008&quot;&gt;Kathryn A. Bard, An Introduction to the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt (Oxford: Blackwell Publishing Ltd, 2008), 128-33.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Djoser is best known for his innovative tomb, which dominates the Saqqara landscape&lt;ref name=&quot;George Hart 1991&quot;&gt;George Hart, Pharaohs and Pyramids, A Guide Through Old Kingdom Egypt (London: The Herbert Press, 1991), 57-68.&lt;/ref&gt;. In this tomb he is referred to by his Horus name Netjerykhet. In fact, Djoser, is a name given by [[New Kingdom]] visitors thousands of years later&lt;ref name=&quot;Mark Lehner 1997&quot;&gt;Mark Lehner, The Complete Book of the Pyramids (New York : Thames and Hudson, 1997), 80-93.&lt;/ref&gt;. Djoser’s step pyramid is astounding in its departure from previous architecture. It sets several important precedents, perhaps the most important of which is its status as the first monumental structure made of stone. The social implications of such a large and carefully sculpted stone structure are staggering&lt;ref name=&quot;Mark Lehner 1997&quot;/&gt;. The process of building such a structure would be far more labor intensive than previous monuments of mud-brick. This suggests that the state, and therefore the royal government had a new level of control of resources, both material and human&lt;ref name=&quot;Kathryn A. Bard 2008&quot;/&gt;. Also, from this point on, kings of the Old Kingdom are buried in the North, rather than at [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]]. Furthermore, although the plan of Djoser’s pyramid complex is different than later complexes, many elements persist and the step pyramid sets the stage for later pyramids of the 4th, 5th, and 6th Dynasties, including the great pyramids at Giza&lt;ref name=&quot;Kathryn A. Bard 2008&quot;/&gt;.  Finally, another intriguing first is the identification of the architect [[Imhotep]], who is credited with the design and construction of the complex&lt;ref name=&quot;Kathryn A. Bard 2008&quot;/&gt;.

==Precedents==
Djoser’s Pyramid draws ideas from several precedents. The most relevant precedent is found at Saqqara mastaba 3038&lt;ref name=&quot;Mark Lehner 1997&quot;/&gt;. The substructure lay in a 4m deep rectangular pit, and had mudbrick walls rising to 6m. Three sides were extended and built out to create eight shallow steps rising at an angle of 49˚&lt;ref name=&quot;Mark Lehner 1997&quot;/&gt;. This would have been an elongated step pyramid if the remaining side had not been left uncovered. In another parallel to Djoser’s complex, to complete this mastaba complex a niched enclosure wall was erected&lt;ref name=&quot;Mark Lehner 1997&quot;/&gt;. Furthermore, the pyramid substructure is reminiscent of the plan of [[Khasekhemwy]]’s mud-brick funerary enclosure at Abydos&lt;ref name=&quot;Kathryn A. Bard 2008&quot;/&gt;.

==Overview==  	
[[Image:Temples at Festival complex.JPG|thumb|250px|Temples of the festival complex.]] 

Djoser’s Step Pyramid complex has several structures pivotal to its function in both life and the afterlife. Several are discussed below with attention paid to function and form. The pyramid was not simply a grave in ancient Egypt. Its purpose was to facilitate a successful afterlife for the king so that he could be eternally reborn. The symbolism of the step pyramid form, which did not survive the 3rd Dynasty, is unknown, but it has been suggested that it may be a monumental symbol of the crown, especially the royal mortuary cult, since seven small step pyramids (not tombs) were built in the provinces&lt;ref name=&quot;Kathryn A. Bard 2008&quot;/&gt;. Another well accepted theory is that it facilitated the king’s ascension to join the eternal North Star&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin Isler 2001&quot;&gt;Martin Isler, Sticks ,Stones ,and Shadows: Building the Egyptian Pyramids (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 2001), 90-99.&lt;/ref&gt;.

The main excavator of the Step Pyramid was Jean-Phillipe Lauer, a French architect who reconstructed key portions of the complex[2]. The complex covers 15ha and is about 2.5 times as large as the Old Kingdom town of Heirakonpolis&lt;ref name=&quot;Kathryn A. Bard 2008&quot;/&gt;. Several features of the complex differ from those of later Old Kingdom pyramids. The pyramid temple is situated at the north side of the pyramid, whereas in later pyramids it is on the east side. Also, the Djoser complex is built on a North-South axis whereas later complexes utilize an East-West axis&lt;ref name=&quot;Mark Lehner 1997&quot;/&gt;. Furthermore, the Djoser complex has one niched enclosure wall, whereas later pyramids have two enclosure walls with the outside one being smooth and the inside one sometimes niched&lt;ref name=&quot;Mark Lehner 1997&quot;/&gt;. 

==The Enclosure Wall==
The Djoser complex is surrounded by a wall of light Tura limestone 10.5m high&lt;ref name=&quot;Alberto Siliotti 1997&quot;&gt;Alberto Siliotti, Guide to the Pyramids of Egypt with forward by Zahi Hawass (New York: Barnes and Noble Books, 1997), 105-113.&lt;/ref&gt;. The wall design recalls the appearance of 1st Dynasty tombs, with the distinctive paneled construction known as the palace façade, which imitates bound bundles of reeds&lt;ref name=&quot;A.J. Spencer, Early Egypt 1993&quot;&gt;A.J. Spencer, Early Egypt: The Rise of Civilization in the Nile Valley (London: British Museum Press, 1993), 98-110.&lt;/ref&gt;. The overall structure imitates mudbrick&lt;ref name=&quot;Mark Lehner 1997&quot;/&gt;. The wall is interrupted by 14 doors, however only one entrance, in the south corner of the east façade, is functional for the living. This arrangement resembles Early Dynastic funerary enclosures at Abydos in which the entrance was on the east side&lt;ref name=&quot;Gay Robins 2000&quot;/&gt;. The remaining doors are known as false doors, and were meant for the king’s use in the afterlife. They functioned as portals through which the king’s ka could pass between life and the afterlife. The functional door at the southeast end of the complex leads to a narrow passageway that connects to the roofed colonnade&lt;ref name=&quot;Alberto Siliotti 1997&quot;/&gt;.

==The Great Trench==

Outside the enclosure wall Djoser’s complex is completely surrounded by a trench dug in the underlying rock. The trench measures 750m long and 40m wide and is a rectangle on a North-South axis. The walls of the trench were originally decorated with niches and its function seems to have been to make entry into the complex more difficult&lt;ref name=&quot;Miroslav Verner 1998&quot;&gt;Miroslav Verner, The Pyramids (New York: Grove Press, 1998), 105-139.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==Roofed colonnade entrance==
[[File:Saqqara - Pyramid of Djoser - Mortuary temple - Hypostyle hall .JPG|Roofed colonnade corridor leading into the complex, with stone pillars carved to imitate bundled plant stems.|thumb|250px]]
The roofed colonnade led from the enclosure wall to the south of the complex&lt;ref name=&quot;Kathryn A. Bard 2008&quot;&gt;Kathryn A. Bard, An Introduction to the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt (Oxford: Blackwell Publishing Ltd, 2008), 128-33&lt;/ref&gt;. A passageway with a limestone ceiling constructed to look as though it was made from whole tree trunks led to a massive stone imitation of two open doors. Beyond this portal was a hall with twenty pairs of limestone columns composed of drum shaped segments built to look like bundles of plant stems and reaching a height of 6.6 m&lt;ref name=&quot;Kathryn A. Bard 2008&quot;/&gt;. The columns were not free-standing, but were attached to the wall by masonry projections&lt;ref name=&quot;Miroslav Verner 1998&quot;/&gt;. Between the columns on both sides of the hall were small chambers, which some Egyptologists propose may have been for each of the provinces of Upper and Lower Egypt&lt;ref name=&quot;Miroslav Verner 1998&quot;/&gt;. At the end of the colonnade was the transverse hypostyle room with eight columns connected in pairs by blocks of limestone&lt;ref name=&quot;A.J. Spencer, Early Egypt 1993&quot;/&gt;. This led to the South Court&lt;ref name=&quot;George Hart 1991&quot;/&gt;.

==The South Court==
The South Court is a large court between the South Tomb and the pyramid. Within the court are curved stones thought to be territorial markers associated with the [[Sed festival|Heb-sed festival]], an important ritual completed by Egyptian kings (typically after 30 years on the throne) to renew their powers&lt;ref name=&quot;Kathryn A. Bard 2008&quot;/&gt;. These would have allowed Djoser to claim control over all of Egypt &lt;ref name=&quot;Kathryn A. Bard 2008&quot;/&gt;, while its presence in the funerary complex would allow Djoser to continue to benefit from the ritual in the afterlife &lt;ref name=&quot;Gay Robins 2000&quot;&gt;Gay Robins, The Art of Ancient Egypt (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2000), 40-45.&lt;/ref&gt;. At the southern end of the court was a platform approached by steps. It has been suggested that this was a platform for the double throne &lt;ref name=&quot;Gay Robins 2000&quot;/&gt;.  This fits in to the theory proposed by Barry Kemp, and generally accepted by many, that suggests the whole step pyramid complex symbolizes the royal palace enclosure and allows the king to eternally perform the rituals associated with kingship &lt;ref name=&quot;Gay Robins 2000&quot;/&gt;. At the very south of the South Court lay the South Tomb.

==The South Tomb==
The South Tomb has been likened to the satellite pyramids of later Dynasties, and has been proposed to house the ka in the afterlife&lt;ref name=&quot;Mark Lehner 1997&quot;/&gt;. Another proposal is that it may have held the canopic jar with the king’s organs, but this does not follow later trends where the canopic jar is found in the same place as the body&lt;ref name=&quot;Mark Lehner 1997&quot;/&gt;. These proposals stem from the fact that the granite burial vault is much too small to have facilitated an actual burial&lt;ref name=&quot;Mark Lehner 1997&quot;/&gt;.

The substructure of the South Tomb is entered through a tunnel-like corridor with a staircase that descends about 30m before opening up into the pink granite burial chamber. The staircase then continues west and leads to a gallery that imitates the blue chambers below the step pyramid&lt;ref name=&quot;Miroslav Verner 1998&quot;/&gt;.

Current evidence suggests that the South Tomb was finished before the pyramid&lt;ref name=&quot;Mark Lehner 1997&quot;/&gt;. The symbolic king’s inner palace, decorated in blue faience, is much more complete than that of the pyramid&lt;ref name=&quot;Mark Lehner 1997&quot;/&gt;. Three chambers of this substructure are decorated in blue faience to imitate reed-mat facades, just like the pyramid&lt;ref name=&quot;Mark Lehner 1997&quot;/&gt;. One room is decorated with three finely niche reliefs of the king, one depicting him running the [[Sed festival|Heb-sed]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Kathryn A. Bard 2008&quot;/&gt;.  Importantly, Egyptian builders chose to employ their most skilled artisans and depict their finest art in the darkest, most inaccessible place in the complex. This highlights the fact that this impressive craftsmanship was not meant for the benefit of the living but was meant to ensure the king had all the tools necessary for a successful afterlife&lt;ref name=&quot;Mark Lehner 1997&quot;/&gt;

==The Step Pyramid==
The superstructure of the Step Pyramid is six steps and was built in six stages, as might be expected with an experimental structure&lt;ref name=&quot;A.J. Spencer, Early Egypt 1993&quot;/&gt;. The pyramid began as a square mastaba (one should note that this designation as a mastaba is contended for several reasons) (M1) which was gradually enlarged, first evenly on all four sides (M2) and later just on the east side (M3)&lt;ref name=&quot;A.J. Spencer, Early Egypt 1993&quot;/&gt;. The mastaba was built up in two stages, first to form a four-stepped structure (P1) and then to form a six-stepped structure (P2), which now had a rectangular base on an east-west axis&lt;ref name=&quot;Miroslav Verner 1998&quot;/&gt;. The fact that the initial mastaba was square has led many to believe that the monument was never meant to be a mastaba, as no other known mastabas had ever been square&lt;ref name=&quot;Miroslav Verner 1998&quot;/&gt;.The final pyramid was 62m tall and 1221 square meters in area&lt;ref name=&quot;Kathryn A. Bard 2008&quot;/&gt;. When the builders began to transform the mastaba into the four step pyramid, they made a major shift in construction&lt;ref name=&quot;Mark Lehner 1997&quot;/&gt;. Like in the construction of the mastaba, they built a crude core of rough stones and then cased them in fine limestone with packing in between&lt;ref name=&quot;Mark Lehner 1997&quot;/&gt;. The major difference is that in mastaba construction they laid horizontal courses, but for the pyramid layers, they built in accretion layers that leaned inwards, while using blocks that were both bigger and higher quality&lt;ref name=&quot;Mark Lehner 1997&quot;/&gt;. Much of the rock for the pyramid was likely quarried from the construction of the great trench&lt;ref name=&quot;Dick Parry 2004&quot;&gt;Dick Parry, Engineering the Pyramids (Phoenix: Sutton Publishing Limited, 2004), 14&lt;/ref&gt;. It is widely accepted that ramps would have been used to raise heavy stone to construct the pyramid, and many plausible models have been suggested&lt;ref&gt;Dieter Arnold, Building in Egypt, Pharaonic Stone Masonry (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1991), 79-101.&lt;/ref&gt;. Apparatuses like rollers in which the heavy stone could be placed and then rolled were employed in transport&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin Isler 2001&quot;/&gt;.

==Pyramid Substructure==
Under the step pyramid is a labyrinth of tunneled chambers and galleries that total nearly 6&amp;nbsp;km in length and connect to a central shaft 7m square and 28m deep&lt;ref name=&quot;Miroslav Verner 1998&quot;/&gt;. These spaces provide room for the king’s burial, the burial of family members, and the storage of goods and offerings&lt;ref name=&quot;Dick Parry 2004&quot;/&gt;. The entrance to the 28m shaft was built on the north side of the pyramid, a trend that would remain throughout the Old Kingdom&lt;ref name=&quot;Dick Parry 2004&quot;/&gt;. The sides of the underground passages are limestone inlaid with blue faience tile to replicate reed matting. These “palace façade” walls are further decorated by panels decorated in low relief that show the king participating in the Heb-sed&lt;ref name=&quot;Dick Parry 2004&quot;/&gt;. Together these chambers constitute the funerary apartment that mimicked the palace and would serve as the living place of the royal ka&lt;ref name=&quot;A.J. Spencer, Early Egypt 1993&quot;/&gt;. On the east side of the pyramid eleven shafts 32m deep were constructed and annexed to horizontal tunnels for the royal harem (The existence of this &quot;harem&quot; is debated) &lt;ref name=&quot;A.J. Spencer, Early Egypt 1993&quot;/&gt;. These were incorporated into the preexisting substructure as it expanded eastward. In the storerooms along here over 40,000 stone vessels were found, many of which predate Djoser&lt;ref name=&quot;Kathryn A. Bard 2008&quot;/&gt;. These would have served Djoser’s visceral needs in the afterlife. An extensive network of underground galleries was located to the north, west and south of the central burial chamber and crude horizontal magazines were carved into these&lt;ref name=&quot;Mark Lehner 1997&quot;/&gt;. 

==The Burial Chamber==

The burial chamber was a vault constructed of four courses of well-dressed granite. It had one opening, which was sealed with a 3.5 ton block after the burial&lt;ref name=&quot;George Hart 1991&quot;/&gt;. No body was recovered as the tomb had been extensively robbed&lt;ref name=&quot;Mark Lehner 1997&quot;/&gt;. Lauer believes that a burial chamber of alabaster existed before the one of granite. He found interesting evidence of limestone blocks with five pointed stars in low relief that were likely on the ceiling, indicating the first occurrence of what would become a tradition&lt;ref name=&quot;Mark Lehner 1997&quot;/&gt;. The king sought to associate himself with the eternal North Stars that never set so as to ensure his rebirth and eternity&lt;ref name=&quot;Gay Robins 2000&quot;/&gt;.  

==The North Temple and Serdab Court==

The northern (funerary/mortuary) temple was on the north side of the pyramid and faced the north stars, which the king wished to join in eternity. This structure provided a place in which the daily rituals and offerings to the dead could be performed, and was the cult center for the king&lt;ref name=&quot;Gay Robins 2000&quot;/&gt;. To the east of the temple is the serdab, which is a small enclosed structure that housed the ka statue. The king’s ka inhabited the ka statue in order to benefit from daily ceremonies like the opening of the mouth, a ceremony that allowed him to breathe and eat, and the burning of incense&lt;ref name=&quot;Gay Robins 2000&quot;/&gt;. He witnessed these ceremonies through two small eye holes cut in the north wall of the serdab&lt;ref name=&quot;Gay Robins 2000&quot;/&gt;. This temple appears on the north side of the pyramid throughout the Third Dynasty, as the king wishes to go north to become one of the eternal stars in the North Sky that never set&lt;ref name=&quot;Miroslav Verner 1998&quot;/&gt;. In the fourth Dynasty, when there is a religious shift to an emphasis on rebirth and eternity achieved through the sun, the temple is moved to the east side of the temple where the sun rises, so that through association the king may be reborn every day&lt;ref name=&quot;Miroslav Verner 1998&quot;/&gt;.

==The Heb-sed Court==

The Heb-sed courtyard is rectangular and parallel to the South Courtyard. It was meant to provide a space in which the king could perform the Heb-sed ritual in the afterlife&lt;ref name=&quot;Mark Lehner 1997&quot;/&gt;. Flanking the east and west sides of the court are the remains of two groups of chapels, many of which are dummy buildings, of three different architectural styles&lt;ref name=&quot;A.J. Spencer, Early Egypt 1993&quot;/&gt;. At the north and south ends there are three chapels with flat roves and no columns&lt;ref name=&quot;A.J. Spencer, Early Egypt 1993&quot;/&gt;. The remaining chapels on the west side are decorated with fluted columns and capitals flanked by leaves&lt;ref name=&quot;Miroslav Verner 1998&quot;/&gt;. Each of the chapels has a sanctuary accessed by a roofless passage with walls that depict false doors and latches&lt;ref name=&quot;A.J. Spencer, Early Egypt 1993&quot;/&gt;. Some of these buildings have niches for statues. Egyptologists believe that these buildings were related to the important double coronation of the king during the Heb-sed&lt;ref name=&quot;A.J. Spencer, Early Egypt 1993&quot;/&gt;.

[[File:Hostess twinkies tweaked.jpg|thumb|300px|Twinkies]]

'''Twinkies''' are an American [[snack cake]] made and distributed by [[Hostess Brands]]. They are marketed as a &quot;Golden Sponge Cake with Creamy Filling&quot;.

==History==
Twinkies were invented in [[Schiller Park, Illinois]] in about 1930 by [[James Dewar (baker)|James A. Dewar]], a baker for Continental Bakeries (now Hostess). Realizing that several machines used to make cream-filled strawberry [[shortcake]] sat idle when [[strawberries]] were out of season, Dewar conceived a snack cake filled with [[banana]] cream, which he dubbed the Twinkie. During [[World War II]], bananas were rationed and Hostess was forced to switch to [[vanilla]] cream. This change proved so popular that Hostess never switched back to banana and still uses vanilla cream in Twinkies today.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kitchenproject.com/history/twinkie.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deep-fried Twinkie==
[[Image:deepfried.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A deep-fried Twinkie]]
A deep-fried Twinkie involves freezing the cake, dipping it into [[batter (cooking)|batter]], and deep-frying it to create a variation on the traditional snack cake. It was described by a ''[[The New York Times]]'' story in this way: &quot;Something magical occurs when the pastry hits the hot oil. The creamy white vegetable shortening filling liquefies, impregnating the sponge cake with its luscious vanilla flavor... The cake itself softens and warms, nearly melting, contrasting with the crisp, deep-fried crust in a buttery and suave way. The piece de resistance, however, is a ruby-hued berry sauce, adding a tart sophistication to all that airy sugary goodness&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.melissaclark.net/articles/archives/000051.html | publisher = The New York Times | title = Fry That Twinkie, But Hold the Chips |date= 2002-05-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Texas State Fair]] had introduced the [[deep frying|fried]] Twinkie to great popular acclaim, and the notion spread to other [[state fair]]s across the U.S., as well as some establishments that specialize in fried foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://archives.cnn.com/2002/US/West/09/18/offbeat.twinkie.reut/ | publisher = CNN | title = New junk food fad: Deep-fried Twinkies |date= 2002-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fried Twinkies are sold throughout the U.S. in fairs as well as ball games.

== Cultural references ==
===Twinkie defense===
{{Main|Twinkie defense}}
The [[Twinkie defense]] is a derogatory term for a criminal [[defendant]]'s claim that some unusual factor (such as [[allergies]], [[coffee]], [[nicotine]], or [[sugar]]) diminished the defendant's responsibility for the alleged crime. The term arose from [[Herb Caen]]'s description of the trial of [[Dan White]], who was convicted in the fatal shootings of [[San Francisco]] mayor [[George Moscone]] and city supervisor [[Harvey Milk]]. During the trial, psychiatrist [[Martin Blinder]] testified that White had suffered from [[Clinical depression|depression]], causing [[diminished capacity]]; as an example of this, he mentioned that White, formerly a [[health food]] advocate, had begun eating junk food. Twinkies, specifically, were never actually mentioned in the case.
 
===Science===
A website entitled the T.W.I.N.K.I.E.S. Project&lt;ref&gt;http://www.twinkiesproject.com/&lt;/ref&gt; was launched in 2000 by Christopher Scott Gouge and Todd William Stadler.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.toddstadler.com/&lt;/ref&gt; This site chronicles a series of regimented scientific experiments testing, amongst others, the insulative, electrically resistive, radioactive, and gravitational properties of the &quot;Standard Twinkie&quot;.

===Shelf life===
A common [[urban legend]] claims that Twinkies have a [[shelf life]] of forever, or can last for a relatively long time of ten, fifty, or one hundred years due to chemicals used in production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/food/ingredient/twinkies.asp Urban Legends Reference Pages: Twinkies]&lt;/ref&gt; While this urban legend is false, they can last a relatively long time (25 days or so), due to the fact that Twinkies are made without dairy products and thus spoil more slowly than most bakery items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A46062-2005Apr12.html |title=Twinkies, 75 Years And Counting (washingtonpost.com) |publisher=www.washingtonpost.com |accessdate=2010-05-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Netjerikhet''' or '''Djoser''' ([[Turin King List]] &quot;Dsr-it&quot;; [[Manetho]] &quot;Tosarthros&quot;) is the best-known [[pharaoh]] of the [[Third dynasty of Egypt]]. He commissioned his official, [[Imhotep]], to build the first of the [[pyramid]]s, a [[Pyramid of Djoser|step pyramid]] for him at [[Saqqara]].  Variants of his name include '''Zoser''', '''Dzoser''', '''Zozer''', '''Dsr''', '''Djeser''', '''Djésèr''', '''Horus-Netjerikhet''', and '''Horus-Netjerichet'''.  

There has been significant controversy about dating the reigns of the Old Kingdom, but radiocarbon dates now indicate that  Djoser's reign began sometime between 2691 to 2625 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1189395 Christopher Bronk Ramsey et al., Radiocarbon-Based Chronology for Dynastic Egypt, ''Science'',  Vol. 328. no. 5985 (18 June 2010), pp. 1554 - 1557]&lt;/ref&gt;

The painted [[limestone]] statue of Djoser, now in the [[Egyptian Museum]] in [[Cairo]], is the oldest known life-sized Egyptian statue. Today at the site in Saqqara where it was found, a plaster copy of the statue stands in place of the original. The statue was found during the Antiquities Service Excavations of 1924-1925.

In contemporary inscriptions, he is called ''Netjerikhet'', meaning &quot;body of the gods.&quot; Later sources, which include a [[New Kingdom]] reference to his construction, help confirm that Netjerikhet and Djoser are the same person.

While Manetho names ''Necherophes'' and the Turin King List names [[Nebka]] as the first ruler of the Third dynasty, many [[Egyptologist]]s now believe Djoser was first king of this [[dynasty]], pointing out that the order in which some predecessors of [[Khufu (pharaoh)|Khufu]] are mentioned in the ''[[Papyrus Westcar]]'' suggests Nebka should be placed between Djoser and [[Huni]], not before Djoser. More significantly, the English Egyptologist [[Toby Wilkinson]] has demonstrated that burial seals found at the entrance to [[Khasekhemwy]]'s tomb in Abydos name only Djoser, rather than Nebka. This supports the view that it was Djoser who  buried, and hence directly succeeded, Khasekhemwy, rather than Nebka.&lt;ref&gt;Toby Wilkinson, Early Dynastic Egypt, Routledge, 1999, pp.83 &amp; 95&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reign length==
[[Image:Egypt.Saqqara.DjosersPyramid.01.jpg|175px|thumb|left|[[Step pyramid|Step]] [[pyramid of Djoser]] at [[Saqqara]], Egypt]]

Manetho states Djoser ruled Egypt for twenty-nine years, while the Turin King List states it was only nineteen years. Because of his many substantial building projects, particularly at Saqqara, some scholars argue Djoser must have enjoyed a reign of nearly three decades. Manetho's figure appears to be more accurate, according to Wilkinson's analysis and reconstruction of the ''[[Palermo Stone|Royal Annals]]''. Wilkinson reconstructs the Annals as giving Djoser &quot;'''28 complete or partial years'''&quot;, noting that the cattle counts recorded on Palermo Stone [[Register (sculpture)|register]] V, and Cairo Fragment 1 register V, for the beginning and ending of Djoser's reign, would most likely indicate his regnal Years 1-5 and 19-28.&lt;ref&gt;Toby Wilkinson, Royal Annals of Ancient Egypt, pp.79 &amp; 258&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reign==

Djoser dispatched several military expeditions to the [[Sinai Peninsula]], during which the local inhabitants were subdued. He also sent expeditions there to mine for valuable minerals such as [[turquoise]] and [[copper]]. This is known from inscriptions found in the desert there, sometimes displaying the banner of [[Set (mythology)|Seth]] alongside the symbols of [[Horus]], as had been more common under Khasekhemwy. The Sinai was also strategically important as a buffer between the [[Nile]] valley and Asia. 

His most famous monument was his [[step pyramid]], which entailed the construction of several [[mastaba]] tombs one over another. These forms would eventually lead to the standard pyramid tomb in the later [[Old Kingdom]]. Manetho, many centuries later, alludes to architectural advances of this reign, mentioning that &quot;Tosorthros&quot; discovered how to build with hewn stone, in addition to being remembered as the physician [[Aesculapius]], and for introducing some reforms in the writing system.  Modern scholars think that Manetho originally ascribed (or meant to ascribe) these feats to ''Imuthes'', who was later deified as ''Aesculapius'' by the Greeks and Romans, and who corresponds to [[Imhotep]], the famous minister of Djoser who engineered the Step Pyramid's construction.  

Some fragmentary reliefs found at [[Heliopolis (ancient)|Heliopolis]] and [[Gebelein]] mention Djoser's name and suggest he commissioned construction projects in those cities. Also, he may have fixed the southern boundary of his kingdom at the [[First Cataract]]. An inscription known as the [[Famine Stela]] and claiming to date to the reign of Djoser, but probably created during the [[Ptolemaic Dynasty]], relates how Djoser rebuilt the temple of [[Khnum]] on the island of [[Elephantine]] at the First Cataract, thus ending a seven-year famine in Egypt. Some consider this ancient inscription as a legend at the time it was inscribed. Nonetheless, it does show that more than two millennia after his reign, Egyptians still remembered Djoser.

Although he seems to have started an unfinished tomb at Abydos (Upper Egypt), Djoser was eventually buried in his famous pyramid at Saqqara in Lower Egypt.  Since Khasekhemwy, a pharaoh from the 2nd dynasty, was the last pharaoh to be buried at Abydos, some Egyptologists infer that the shift to a more northerly capital was completed during Djoser's time.

==Family==
Because Queen [[Nimaethap]], the wife of Khasekhemwy, the last king of the [[Second dynasty of Egypt]], is mentioned on a jar sealing of Khasekhemwy with the title &quot;Mother of the King's children&quot;, some writers argue she was Djoser's mother and Khasekhemwy was his father. This is also suggested by another jar sealing, dating to Djoser's reign, calling her &quot;Mother of the King of the Two Lands&quot;.  Her cult seems to have still been active in the later reign of [[Sneferu]]. 

[[Hetephernebti]] is identified as one of Djoser's queens &quot;on a series of boundary stela from the Step Pyramid enclosure (now in various museums) and a fragment of relief from a building at Hermopolis&quot; currently in the Egyptian museum of Turin.&lt;ref&gt;Aidan Dodson &amp; Dyan Hilton, The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt, Thames &amp; Hudson (2004), p.48&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Inetkawes]] was their only daughter known by name. There was also a third royal female attested during Djoser's reign, but her name is destroyed. The relationship between Djoser and his successor, [[Sekhemkhet]], is not known, and the date of his death is uncertain.

In [[linguistics]], '''gerund''' ([[list of glossing abbreviations|abbreviated]] {{sc|'''ger'''}}) is a term used to refer to various [[non-finite verb]] forms in various languages:

* As applied to [[English language|English]], it refers to the usage of a verb (in its [[Continuous and progressive aspects|''-ing'' form]]) as a noun (for example, the verb &quot;learning&quot; in the sentence &quot;Learning is an easy process for some&quot;). This is also the term's use as applied to [[Latin]]; ''see'' [[Latin conjugation#The_gerund|Latin conjugation]].
* As applied to [[Spanish language|Spanish]], it refers to an [[adverbial participle]] (a verbal adverb), called in Spanish the ''gerundio''.
* As applied to [[French language|French]], it refers either to the adverbial participle—also called the ''[[gerundive]]''—or to the present [[adjectival participle]].
* As applied to [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], it refers to an adverbial participle (a verbal adverb), called the ''gerúndio''.
* As applied to [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], it refers either to the verb's action noun, or to the part of the [[infinitive]] following the infinitival prefix (also called the ''infinitival construct'').
* As applied to [[West Frisian language|Frisian]], it refers to one of two verb forms frequently referred to as infinitives, this one ending in -n. It shows up in [[nominalization]]s and is selected by perception verbs.
* As applied to [[Japanese language|Japanese]], it designates verb and verbals adjective forms in dictionary form paired with the referral particle ''no'', which turns the verbal into a concept or property noun.
* As applied to [[Turkish language|Turkish]], it refers to the [[Turkish grammar#Verbal nouns|Turkish verbal nouns]] formed by appending ''-ma'' or ''-me'', depending on [[vowel harmony]], to the verb stem. The Turkish gerund is rather similar in meaning and use to the English gerund.
* As applied to other languages, it may refer to almost any non-finite verb form; however, it most often refers to an action noun, by analogy with its use as applied to English or Latin.

==Etymology==
The word 'gerund' in English comes form the Latin term ''gerundium'', of the same meaning. ''Gerundium'' itself comes from the [[gerundive]] of the Latin verb ''gero'', ''gerundus'', meaning &quot;to be carried out&quot;.

==Gerunds in English==

In English, the gerund is identical in form to the present [[participle]] (ending in ''-ing'') and can behave as a [[verb]] within a [[clause]] (so that it may be modified by an [[adverb]] or have an [[Object (grammar)|object]]), but the clause as a whole (sometimes consisting of only one word, the gerund itself) acts as a [[noun]] within the larger sentence. For example: '''''Eating''' this cake is easy.''

In &quot;Eating this cake is easy,&quot; &quot;eating this cake,&quot; although traditionally known as a [[phrase]], is referred to as a [[non-finite clause]] in modern [[linguistics]].  &quot;Eating&quot; is the verb in the clause, while &quot;this cake&quot; is the object of the verb.  &quot;Eating this cake&quot; acts as a [[noun phrase]] within the sentence as a whole, though; it is the subject of the verb &quot;is.&quot;

Other examples of the gerund:
* ''I like '''swimming'''.'' (direct object)
* '''''Swimming''' is fun.'' ([[Subject (grammar)|subject]])

Some use &quot;gerund&quot; to refer to all nouns ending in ''-ing,'' but in more careful use, not all nouns ending in ''-ing'' are gerunds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wordwizard.com/phpbb3/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=&amp;p=47234#p47234 Re: Post Hey man, I gots ta know (Gerund versus gerundive)], Phil White, Mon August 7, 2006 1:35 pm&lt;/ref&gt; The formal distinction is that a gerund is a [[verbal noun|''verbal'' noun]] – a noun derived from a verb that retains verb characteristics, that functions ''simultaneously'' as a noun and a verb, while other nouns ending in ''-ing'' are [[deverbal noun|''de''verbal nouns]], which function as common nouns, not as verbs at all. Compare:
* ''I like '''fencing'''.'' (gerund, an activity, could be replaced with &quot;to fence&quot;)
* ''The white '''fencing''' adds to the character of the neighborhood.'' (deverbal, could be replaced with an object such as &quot;bench&quot;)

===Double nature of the gerund===
As the result of its origin and development the gerund has nominal and verbal properties. The ''nominal'' characteristics of the gerund are as follows:
# The gerund can perform the function of [[Subject (grammar)|subject]], [[Object (grammar)|object]] and [[Predicative (adjectival or nominal)|predicative]]:
#* '''''Smoking''' endangers your health.'' ([[Subject (grammar)|subject]])
#* ''I like '''making''' people happy.'' ([[Object (grammar)|object]])
# The gerund can be preceded by a [[preposition]]:
#* ''I'm tired '''of arguing'''.''
# Like a [[noun]] the gerund can be modified by a [[noun]] in the [[possessive case]], a [[possessive adjective]], or an [[adjective]]:
#* ''I wonder at '''John's keeping''' calm.''
#* ''Is there any objection to '''my seeing''' her?''
#* '''''Brisk walking''' relieves stress.''
The ''verbal'' characteristics of the gerund include the following:
# The gerund of [[transitive verbs]] can take a [[direct object]]:
#* ''I've made good progress in '''speaking English'''.''
# The gerund can be modified by an [[adverb]]:
#* '''''Breathing deeply''' helps you to calm down.''
# The gerund has the distinctions of [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]] and [[Grammatical voice|voice]].
#* '''''Having read the book once before''' makes me more prepared.''
#* '''''Being deceived''' can make someone feel angry.''

===Verb patterns with the gerund===
Verbs that are often followed by a gerund include ''admit, adore, anticipate, appreciate, avoid, carry on, consider, contemplate, delay, deny, describe, detest, dislike, enjoy, escape, fancy, feel, finish, give, hear, imagine, include, justify, listen to, mention, mind, miss, notice, observe, perceive, postpone, practice, quit, recall, report, resent, resume, risk, see, sense, sleep, stop, suggest, tolerate'' and ''watch''. 
Additionally, [[preposition]]s are often followed by a gerund.

For example:
* ''I will never quit smoking.''
* ''We postponed making any decision.''
* ''After two years of deciding, we finally made a decision.'' 
* ''We heard whispering.''
* ''They denied having avoided me.''
* ''He talked me into coming to the party.''
* ''They frightened her out of voicing her opinion.''
====Verbs followed by a gerund or a to-infinitive====
=====With little change in meaning=====

''advise, recommend'' and ''forbid'':

These are followed by a ''to''-infinitive when there is an object as well, but by a gerund otherwise.

* ''The police advised us not to enter the building, for a murder had occurred.'' (''Us'' is the object of ''advised''.)
* ''The police advised against our entering the building.'' (''Our'' is used for the gerund ''entering''.)

''consider, contemplate'' and ''recommend'':

These verbs are followed by a ''to''-infinitive only in the [[English passive voice|passive]] or with an object pronoun.

* ''People consider her to be the best.'' &amp;ndash; ''She is considered to be the best.''
* ''I am considering sleeping over, if you do not mind.''

''begin, continue, start; hate, like, love, prefer''

With ''would'', the verbs ''hate, like, love'', and ''prefer'' are usually followed by the ''to''-[[infinitive]].

* ''I would like to work there.'' (more usual than ''working'')

When talking about sports, there is usually a difference in meaning between the infinitive and gerund (see the next section).

=====With a change in meaning=====

''like, love, prefer''

In some contexts, following these verbs with a ''to''-infinitive when the subject of the first verb is the subject of the second verb provides more clarity than a gerund.

* ''I like to box.'' (I enjoy doing it myself.)
* ''I like boxing.'' (Either I enjoy watching it, I enjoy doing it myself, or the idea of boxing is otherwise appealing )
* ''I do not like gambling, but I do like to gamble.&quot; 

''dread'', ''hate'' and ''cannot bear'':

These verbs are followed by a ''to''-infinitive when talking subjunctively (often when using ''to think''), but by a gerund when talking about general dislikes.

* ''I dread / hate to think what she will do.''
* ''I dread / hate seeing him.''
* ''I cannot bear to see you suffer like this.'' (You are suffering now.)
* ''I cannot bear being pushed around in crowds.'' (I never like that.)

''forget'' and ''remember'':

When these have meanings that are used to talk about the future from the given time, the ''to''-infinitive is used, but when looking back in time, the gerund.

* ''She forgot to tell me her plans.'' (She did not tell me, although she should have.)
* ''She forgot telling me her plans.'' (She told me, but then forgot having done so.)
* ''I remembered to go to work.'' (I remembered that I needed to go to work.)
* ''I remembered going to work.'' (I remembered that I went to work.)

''go on'':

* ''After winning the semi-finals, he went on to play in the finals.'' (He completed the semi-finals and later played in the finals.)
* ''He went on giggling, not having noticed the teacher enter.'' (He continued doing so.)

''mean'':

* ''I did not mean to scare you off.'' (I did not intend to scare you off.)
* ''Taking a new job in the city meant leaving behind her familiar surroundings.'' (If she took the job, she would have to leave behind her familiar surroundings.)

''regret'':

* ''We regret to inform you that you have failed your exam.'' (polite or formal form of apology)
* ''I very much regret saying what I said.'' (I wish that I had not said that.)

''try'':

When a ''to''-infinitive is used, the subject is shown to make an effort at something, attempt or endeavor to do something. If a gerund is used, the subject is shown to attempt to do something in testing to see what might happen.

* ''Please try to remember to post my letter.''
* ''I have tried being stern, but to no avail.''

====Gerunds preceded by a genitive====
Because of its noun properties, the [[Genitive case|genitive]] (possessive case) is preferred for a noun or pronoun preceding a gerund.
* ''We enjoyed their'' [genitive] ''singing.''

This usage is preferred in formal writing or speaking. The objective case is often used in place of the possessive, especially in casual situations:
*''I do not see it making any difference.''

Really, 'I do not see its making any difference' is the correct option.

This may sound awkward in general use, but is still the correct manner in which to converse or write. And this form of gerund is applicable in all relative cases, for instance:
*''He affected my going there.''
*''He affected your going there.''
*''He affected his/her/its going there.''
*''He affected our going there.''
*''He affected their going there.''

This is because the action, of doing or being, belongs, in effect, to the subject/object (direct or indirect) practising it, thus, the possessive is required to clearly demonstrate that.

In some cases, either the possessive or the objective case may be logical:
*''The teacher's shouting startled the student.'' (''Shouting'' is a gerund, and ''teacher's'' is a possessive noun. The shouting is the subject of the sentence.)
*''The teacher shouting startled the student.'' (''Shouting'' is a participle describing the teacher. This sentence means ''The teacher who was shouting startled the student.'' In this sentence, the subject is the teacher herself.)
Either of these sentences could mean that the student was startled because the teacher was shouting.

Using the objective case can be awkward if the gerund is singular but the other noun is plural. It can look like a problem with subject-verb agreement:
*''The politicians' debating was interesting.''
One might decide to make ''was'' plural so that ''debating'' can be a participle.
*''The politicians debating were interesting.

===Gerunds and present participles===
Insofar as there is a distinction between gerunds and present participles, it is generally fairly clear which is which; a gerund or participle that is the subject or object of a preposition is a gerund if it refers to the ''performance'' of an action (but present participles may be used [[substantive adjective|substantively]] to refer to the ''performer'' of an action), while one that modifies a noun [[attributive adjective|attributively]] or [[absolute adjective|absolutely]] is a participle. The main source of potential ambiguity is when a gerund-participle follows a verb; in this case, it may be seen either as a predicate adjective (in which case it is a participle), or as a direct object or predicate nominative (in either of which cases it is a gerund). In this case, a few transformations can help distinguish them. In the table that follows, ungrammatical sentences are marked with asterisks, per common linguistic practice; it should be noted that the transformations all produce grammatical sentences with similar meanings when applied to sentences with gerunds but either ungrammatical sentences, or sentences with completely different meanings, when applied to sentences with participles.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Transformation !! Gerund use !! Participle use
|-
!(''none'')
| John suggested asking Bill. || John kept asking Bill.
|-
![[English passive voice|Passivization]]
| Asking Bill was suggested. || *Asking Bill was kept.
|-
![[Pronoun|Pronominal]] substitution
| John suggested it. || *John kept it.
|-
!Use as a noun
| John suggested the asking of Bill. || *John kept the asking of Bill.
|-
!Replacement with a finite [[clause]]
| John suggested that Bill be asked. || *John kept that Bill be asked.
|-
!Use with an objective or possessive subject
| John suggested our asking Bill. || *John kept his asking Bill.
|-
![[Cleft sentence|Clefting]]
| Asking Bill is what John suggested. || *Asking Bill is what John kept.
|-
![[Left dislocation]]
| Asking Bill John suggested. || *Asking Bill John kept.
|}

None of these transformations is a perfect test, however.

===English gerund-like words in other languages===
English words ending in ''-ing'' are often transformed into [[pseudo-anglicism]]s in other languages, where their use is somewhat different from in English itself. In many of these cases, the loanword has functionally become a noun rather than a gerund. For instance, ''camping'' is a campsite in Bulgarian, Dutch, French, Greek, Italian, Romanian, Russian, and Spanish; in Bulgarian, Dutch, French, Polish, and Russian ''parking'' is a car park; ''lifting'' is a facelift in Bulgarian, French, German, Italian, Polish, Romanian, and Spanish. The French word for shampoo is ''(le) shampooing''.

==The gerund in popular culture==

In the [[Nigel Molesworth|Molesworth]] books by [[Geoffrey Willans]] and [[Ronald Searle]], Searle included a series of cartoons on the [http://www.stcustards.free-online.co.uk/topp/latin/latin2.htm private life of the gerund], intended to parody the linguistic snobbery of Latin teachers' striving after strict grammatical correctness and the difficulty experienced by students in comprehending the construction.

[[Owen Johnson]]'s &quot;Lawrenceville Stories&quot; feature a Latin teacher who constantly demands that his students determine whether a given word is a gerund or a [[gerundive]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Natron''' is a naturally occurring mixture of [[sodium carbonate]] decahydrate ([[sodium|Na]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[[carbon|C]][[oxygen|O]]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'''·'''10[[water|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]], a kind of [[soda ash]]) and about 17% [[sodium bicarbonate]] (also called [[nahcolite]]&lt;ref&gt;''webmineral.com'', [http://webmineral.com/data/Nahcolite.shtml &quot;Nahcolite&quot;], retrieved 5 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt; or [[baking soda]], Na[[hydrogen|H]]CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) along with small quantities of household [[salt]] ([[halite]], [[sodium chloride]]) and [[sodium sulfate]]. Natron is white to colourless when pure, varying to gray or yellow with impurities. Natron deposits are sometimes found in saline lake beds which arose in arid environments. Throughout history natron has had many practical applications which still resonate in the wide range of modern uses of its constituent mineral components.

In modern [[mineralogy]] the term ''natron'' has come to mean only the ''sodium carbonate decahydrate'' (hydrated soda ash) which makes up most of the historical salt.

== Etymology ==

The [[English language|English]] word ''natron'' is a [[French language|French]] [[cognate]] derived from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''natrón'' through the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] نطرون ''natrun'' from [[Greek language|Greek]] νιτρων ''nitron'', which derived from the [[Ancient Egyptian]] word for natron, &lt;hiero&gt;N35:D21:X1-G14&lt;/hiero&gt; ''netjeri''. The modern chemical symbol for [[sodium]], '''Na''', is an abbreviation of that element's [[New Latin]] name ''natrium'', which was derived from ''natron''.

== Importance in antiquity ==

Historical natron was harvested directly as a salt mixture from dry lake beds in [[Ancient Egypt]] and has been used for thousands of years as a cleaning product for both the home and body. Blended with oil, it was an early form of [[soap]]. It [[Water softening|softens water]] whilst removing oil and grease. Undiluted, natron was a cleanser for the teeth and an early [[mouthwash]]. The mineral was mixed into early [[antiseptics]] for wounds and minor cuts. Natron can be used to dry and preserve fish and meat. It was also an ancient household insecticide, was used for making leather and as a bleach for clothing.

The mineral was used in Egyptian [[mummy|mummification]] because it absorbs water and behaves as a drying agent. Moreover, when exposed to moisture the carbonate in natron increases pH, which creates a hostile environment for bacteria. In some cultures natron was thought to enhance spiritual safety for both the living and the dead. Natron was added to [[castor oil]] to make a smokeless fuel, which allowed Egyptian artisans to paint elaborate artworks inside ancient tombs without staining them with soot.

Natron is an ingredient for making a distinct color called ''[[Egyptian blue]]''. It was used along with [[sand]] and [[lime (mineral)|lime]] in ceramic and glass-making by the Romans and others at least until [[640]] CE. The mineral was also employed as a [[flux (metallurgy)|flux]] to solder precious metals together.

=== Decline in use ===
Most of natron's uses both in the home and by industry were gradually replaced with closely related sodium compounds and minerals. Natron's [[detergent]] properties are now commercially supplied by [[soda ash]], the mixture's chief compound ingredient, along with other chemicals. Soda ash also replaced natron in glass-making. Some of its ancient household roles are also now filled by ordinary [[baking soda]], natron's other meaningful ingredient.

== Chemistry of hydrated sodium carbonate ==

Natron is also the mineralogical name for the compound sodium carbonate decahydrate (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'''·'''10H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), which is the main component in historical natron.&lt;ref&gt;''webmineral.com'', [http://webmineral.com/data/Natron.shtml &quot;Natron&quot;], retrieved 5 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Sodium carbonate decahydrate has a [[specific gravity]] of 1.42 to 1.47 and a [[Mohs hardness]] of 1. It crystallizes in the [[monoclinic]]-domatic [[crystal system]], typically forming efflorescences and encrustations.

The term ''hydrated sodium carbonate'' is commonly used to encompass the monohydrate (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'''·'''H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), the decahydrate and the heptahydrate (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'''·'''7H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), but is often used in industry to refer to the decahydrate only. Both the hepta- and the decahydrate effloresce (lose water) in dry air and are partially transformed into the monohydrate [[thermonatrite]] Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'''·'''H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.

=== As a source of soda ash ===

Sodium carbonate decahydrate is stable at room temperature but recrystallizes at only {{convert|32|°C|°F|abbr=on}} to sodium carbonate heptahydrate, Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'''·'''7H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, then above {{convert|37|-|38|C|F}} to sodium carbonate monohydrate, Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'''·'''H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. This recrystallization from decahydrate to monohydrate releases much crystal water in a mostly clear, colorless salt solution with little solid [[thermonatrite]]. The mineral natron is often found in association with [[thermonatrite]], [[nahcolite]], [[trona]], [[halite]], [[mirabilite]], [[gaylussite]], [[gypsum]], and [[calcite]].
Most industrially produced sodium carbonate is soda ash, sodium carbonate anhydrate Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, which is obtained by calcination (dry heating at temperatures of 150 to 200°C) of sodium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate monohydrate, or [[trona]].

== Geological occurrence ==

Geologically, the mineral natron as well as the historical natron are formed as transpiro-[[evaporite]] minerals, i.e. crystallizing during the drying up of salt lakes rich in sodium carbonate. The sodium carbonate is usually formed by absorption of [[carbon dioxide]] from the atmosphere by a highly alkaline, sodium-rich lake [[brine]], according to the following reaction scheme:

NaOH&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; -&gt; NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3(aq)&lt;/sub&gt;

NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; + NaOH&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; -&gt; Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Pure deposits of sodium carbonate decahydrate are rare, due to the limited temperature stability of this compound and due to the fact, that the absorption of [[carbon dioxide]] usually produces mixtures of [[bicarbonate]] and [[carbonate]] in solution. From such mixtures, the mineral natron (and also the historical one) will only be formed, if the [[brine]] temperature during evaporation is maximally ca. {{convert|20|°C|°F|abbr=on}} - or the [[alkalinity]] of the lake is so high, that little [[bicarbonate]] is present in solution (see reaction scheme above) - in which case the maximum temperature is increased to ca. {{convert|30|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. In most cases the mineral natron will form together with some amount of [[nahcolite]] ([[sodium bicarbonate]]), resulting in salt mixtures like the historical natron.
Otherwise, the minerals [[trona]]&lt;ref&gt;http://webmineral.com/data/Trona.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; or [[thermonatrite]] and [[nahcolite]] are commonly formed. As the evaporation of a salt lake will occur over geological time spans, during which also part or all of the salt beds might redissolve and recrystallize, deposits of sodium carbonate can be composed of layers of all these minerals.

'''Nancy A. Collins''' (born 10 September 1959) is a [[United States]] [[horror fiction]] writer best known for her series of [[vampire]] novels featuring her character Sonja Blue.  Collins has also
written for [[comic books]], including the [[Swamp Thing]] series, ''Jason Vs. Leatherface'', ''Predator: Hell Come A Walkin'' and her own one-shot ''Dhampire: Stillborn''.

Collins was born in [[McGehee, Arkansas|McGehee]], Arkansas, [[United States]]. She lived in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], Louisiana in the 1980s; after time in  [[New York City]] and [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], Georgia she settled in [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]], North Carolina in the late 2000s.

==Writing==
Collins has written fourteen novels since 1989, most of which refer to and directly include races of creatures the author calls Pretenders, monsters from myth and legend passing as human to better hunt their prey. She is best known for her visceral, almost splatterpunk style of writing,{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} which holds back very little from the reader, and is best personified by her signature character, Sonja Blue.

      <text xml:space="preserve">:''This is about the baked goods brand. For the potato chip brand, see [[Hostess Potato Chips]]''.
'''Hostess''' is a [[brand]] of [[Hostess Brands]] in the [[United States]], known for its line of snack foods, such as [[Twinkie]]s, CupCakes, [[Chocodile]]s, [[Ding Dong]]s, [[Ho Hos]], [[Suzy Q|Suzy Q's]], [[Sno Balls]], [[Zingers]], Donettes, Mini Muffins, Hostess Fruit Pies, Pudding Pies, and Doughnuts.

Hostess' signature CupCakes - with their distinctive seven vanilla &quot;squiggles&quot; swirling atop a layer of chocolate icing - are reputed by their maker to be the best selling snack cake in history.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hostesscakes.com/cupcakes.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical background ==
[[File:Hostess twinkies tweaked.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Hostess Twinkies]]
In 1925, the Taggart Bakery was selling a new brand of [[white bread]] called [[Wonder Bread]]. The [[Continental Baking Company]] purchased Taggart and began selling Wonder Bread nationwide, and invented Hostess Cakes as an additional brand to increase the company's popularity with retail vendors.

[[Interstate Bakeries Corporation]] purchased the [[Continental Baking Company]] in 1995.

In [[Canada]], [[Vachon Inc.|Vachon]], owned by [[Saputo Incorporated|Saputo]] (and not affiliated with Interstate), owns the rights to the Hostess trademarks.

&lt;!-- (blank line space for formatting purposes) --&gt;

== Comic book advertisements ==
From 1975 until 1982, Hostess ran an advertisement campaign in American comic books. These advertisements featured popular heroes from [[DC Comics]] and [[Marvel Comics]] like [[Batman]], [[Superman]], and [[Spider-Man]] in one page mini-adventures. Each of these adventures was resolved with Hostess products. For example, in the original ad, after being unable to subdue a mummy, Batman pacifies him by giving the mummy Twinkies. Other ads would have the protagonist outwitting the antagonist with the pastries, such as the Hulk preparing to strangle a trio of revolutionaries, but a little boy says that is too violent and instead recommends giving them Hostess Fruit Pies, or Batman outwitting a gourmet villain who is kidnapping chefs by paying a ransom in Hostess Cupcakes instead of money, which causes the villains to voluntarily surrender. Subsequent ads included myriad characters from various publishing houses including Casper the Friendly Ghost, Richie Rich, and various members of the Archie Comics gang as well as Gold Key and Whitman comics licensed characters such as Tweety and Sylvester and The Road Runner. The Archie Comics character Josie is the Hostess champ with well over 25 ads to her credit, frequently as a back-cover to many issues in the late-1970s and early -1980s. This has, however, been a target of parody among comics.

{{Cleanup|date=November 2007}}

'''Not in Our Name''' (NION) was a [[United States]] organization founded on March 23, 2002 to protest the U.S. government's course in the wake of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]]; it disbanded on March 31, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.notinourname.net/ Not In Our Name | National project comes to an end]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Two key documents==
Early in their existence, NION produced two documents&amp;mdash;the &quot;Pledge of Resistance&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.notinourname.net/pledge_about.html&lt;/ref&gt; and the &quot;Statement of Conscience&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.notinourname.net/statement_conscience.html&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;that NION members believe provide focus and expression to the U.S. anti-war movement. 

===&quot;Pledge of Resistance&quot;===
The Pledge is written by [[Starhawk]] and [[Saul Williams]], in the style of [[free verse]], beginning:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
We believe that as people living &lt;br /&gt;
in the United States it is our &lt;br /&gt;
responsibility to resist the injustices &lt;br /&gt;
done by our government, &lt;br /&gt;
in our names &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Not in our name &lt;br /&gt;
will you wage endless war &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
and concluding
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Another world is possible &lt;br /&gt;
and we pledge to make it real.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The pledge opposes what it characterizes as &quot;endless [[war]]&quot;, &quot;[[Blood transfusion|transfusions]] of [[blood]] for [[Petroleum|oil]]&quot;, invasions of foreign countries, bombing [[civilian]]s, and killing children. It goes on, &quot;Not in our name / will you erode the very freedoms / you have claimed to fight for.&quot; It implicitly accuses the [[George W. Bush|Bush administration]] of deeming &quot;whole [[nation|peoples]] or [[country|countries]]&quot; as &quot;[[evil]]&quot; and pledges, among other things, &quot;...alliance with those/ who have come under attack /
for voicing opposition to the war / or for their religion or ethnicity.&quot;

===&quot;Statement of Conscience&quot;===
[[Image:We the People Say No to the Bush Agenda by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|These flags became an international symbol of solidarity with this statement]]NION's &quot;Statement of Conscience&quot;, drafted in spring 2002, first lists a series of criticisms of the Bush Administration and (secondarily) the [[United States Congress|U. S. Congress]] and calls on the people of the U.S. &quot;...to resist the policies and overall political direction that have emerged since September 11, 2001, and which pose grave dangers to the people of the world.&quot; 

Among the specific principles advocated in the statement are the right of [[self-determination]] for peoples and nations and the importance of [[due process]] and dissent. The statement expresses &quot;shock&quot; at &quot;the horrific events of September 11, 2001&quot; but, evoking &quot;similar scenes in [[Baghdad]], [[Panama City]], and, a generation ago, [[Vietnam]]&quot;, describes [[Iraq]] as &quot;a country which has no connection to the horror of September 11&quot;, and deplores the administration's &quot;spirit of revenge&quot; and the &quot;simplistic script of 'good vs. evil': &quot;In our name, the Bush administration, with near unanimity from Congress, not only attacked [[Afghanistan]] but arrogated to itself and its allies the right to rain down military force anywhere and anytime.&quot; 

Referring to the U.S. government's treatment of immigrants in the wake of September 11, the statement accuses the U.S. government of creating &quot;two classes of people: those to whom the basic rights of the U.S. legal system are at least promised, and those who now seem to have no rights at all,&quot; and evokes &quot;the infamous [[concentration camp]]s for [[Japanese-American]]s in [[World War II]].&quot; 

Protesting &quot;a pall of repression&quot; and referring specifically to the [[USA PATRIOT Act]] as emblematic of that repression, it accuses the [[United States executive branch|executive branch]] of usurping &quot;the roles and functions of the other branches of government,&quot; and continues, &quot;We must take the highest officers of the land seriously when they talk of a war that will last a generation and when they speak of a new domestic order. We are confronting a new openly imperial policy towards the world and a domestic policy that manufactures and manipulates fear to curtail rights.&quot; 

NION urges a movement of resistance: &quot;President Bush has declared: 'you’re either with us or against us.' Here is our answer: We refuse to allow you to speak for all the American people... We refuse to be party to these wars and we repudiate any inference that they are being waged in our name or for our welfare...&quot; It indicates as inspiration &quot;...[[Israel]]i reservists who, at great personal risk, declare 'there IS a limit' and [[Refusal to serve in the Israeli military|refuse to serve]] in the occupation of the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza]]&quot;, the [[Abolitionism|abolitionists]], and &quot;those who defied the [[Vietnam War|Vietnam war]]&quot; and concludes, &quot;we will resist the machinery of war and repression and rally others to do everything possible to stop it.&quot;

==2005 Statement of Conscience==
NION issued an updated Statement of Conscience in January 2005, expressing dissent on the occasion of the re-inauguration of [[George W. Bush]] as [[president of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.notinourname.net/soc-jan05.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Slogans==
The group uses the following phrases in its [[rhetoric]]:
* ''Not by our will''
* ''Not in our name''
* ''Not by our hearts''
* I Say NO to the Bush Agenda
* No War On the World
* No Police State Restrictions
* No Round-ups and Detentions

==Controversies==
===Role in the anti-war movement===
{{Refimprovesect|date=July 2009}}
A partial parallel for the founding of '''Not in Our Name''' (NION) is the founding of the anti-war coalition ANSWER. ANSWER was founded on 14 September 2001, on the eve of the [[History of Afghanistan since 1992#U.S. invasion of Afghanistan|U.S. invasion of Afghanistan]], largely by members of the [[Workers World Party]] (WWP). NION was founded on 23 March 2002, largely by members of the [[Revolutionary Communist Party (USA)|Revolutionary Communist Party]] (RCP), which continues to be prominent among its leadership. (In 2005, four years after its founding, the [[Party for Socialism and Liberation]], an offshoot of WWP, became a more prominent influence than the WWP in the leadership of ANSWER.)

Nonetheless, in contrast to ANSWER, NION has a broad set of endorsers and is generally regarded as a cooperative participant in the broader [[anti-war movement]]. An October 2002 article by [[Michael Albert]] and [[Stephen R. Shalom]] in [[Z Magazine|''Z'']] magazine is typical among expressions by anti-war critics of the RCP that, despite its origins, NION is a cooperative participant in the movement. After excoriating the RCP for holding various positions that Albert and Shalom find abhorrent, they then write, &quot;Despite these views, however, RCP does not push its specific positions on NION to the degree that [[International Action Center|IAC]] does on ANSWER. For example, while the ANSWER website offers such things as... [an] IAC backgrounder on Afghanistan..., the NION website and its public positions have no connection to the sometimes bizarre views of the RCP.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=15&amp;ItemID=2527&lt;/ref&gt; This is reflected in the wide range of signatories to their [[#&quot;Statement of Conscience&quot;|&quot;Statement of Conscience&quot;]].

Also, NION is itself now a member of a broader coalition [[United for Peace and Justice]], founded in October 2002 (a year after ANSWER) by individuals and groups seeking to curb ANSWER's influence in the [[anti-war movement]].

An example of NION's willingness to cooperate came when they postponed their national moratorium against the war to coincide with the March 5, 2003 &quot;Books Not Bombs&quot; student strike called by the [[National Youth and Student Peace Coalition]].

===Donation from Larry Flynt===
{{Unbalanced|date=July 2009}}
In 2004, Robert Corsini, an organizer for Not in Our Name publicized [[Hardcore pornography|Hardcore pornographer]] [[Larry Flynt]]'s support for one of their campaigns. [[Aura Bogado]], a [[feminist]] radio producer and news anchor for KPFK, objected privately in e-mail and asked to be removed from the organization's mailing list. Corsini forwarded his response to Bogado (including a copy of the original private e-mail) to NION national organizers, her employers at [[KPFK]], and to Bruce David at Larry Flynt Publishing. Bogado replied to Corisini in detail on NION's public e-mail list, and participated in a sharp debate over the e-mail list that followed. After ''Hustler'' published a series of articles and sexual caricatures attacking Bogado, she made her criticism public in [http://www.hustlingtheleft.com/bogado1.html &quot;Hustling the Left&quot;], published on [[ZNet]] in [[June 2005]]. Bogado charged that Leftist leaders were tacitly supporting [[racism]] and [[misogyny]] by aligning themselves with Flynt, and specifically criticized [[Greg Palast]], [[Amy Goodman]], [[Susie Bright]], and [[Amy Alkon]]. The discussion of her article inspired similar criticism of Leftist leaders cooperating with Flynt by feminists such as [[Nikki Craft]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hustlingtheleft.com/&lt;/ref&gt; and pro-feminist Leftists such as [[Stan Goff]] (&lt;ref&gt;http://stangoff.com/?p=163#comment-1760&lt;/ref&gt;). Shortly after the publication of her article, the Not in Our Name Steering Committee issued a [http://www.notinourname.net/archive/apology-16jun05.htm public apology to Bogado] and objected to the treatment of Bogado in ''Hustler''.

==Antecedents of the name==
Prior to the founding of Not in Our Name, other anti-war groups had used the name, including a group of families who were victims of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|9-11 World Trade Center attack]], and [[Jew]]ish youth protesting [[Israel]]'s policies in the [[Palestinian Territories]]. &quot;Not in Our Name&quot; is also a slogan used by the UK [[Stop the War Coalition]]. &quot;Not in Our Name&quot; has also been a petition drive to be signed by Muslims by [[Council on American-Islamic Relations|CAIR]], in which they say it is &quot;not in the name of Muslims&quot; that terrorist leaders such as Osama bin Ladin and Hambali are making these claims.

'''Hostess Brands, Inc.''' (formerly '''Interstate Bakeries Corporation''' (IBC)) is the largest wholesale baker and distributor of fresh bakery products in the [[United States]], and is the owner of the [[Hostess (brand)|Hostess]], [[Wonder Bread]], [[Nature's Pride]], [[Dolly Madison]], '''Butternut Breads''', and [[Drake's]] brands. For many years it was based at 12 East [[Armour Boulevard]], [[Kansas City, Missouri]].  After it emerged from bankruptcy in 2009 it moved to [[Irving, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://economy.kansascity.com/?q=node/1198 IBC moving headquarters to Dallas - Kansas City Star - February 17, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Interstate-bakeries1.jpg|thumb|300px|Former headquarters on Armour Boulevard in Kansas City]]
[[Image:InterstateBakeries.png|thumb|275px|Former Interstate Bakeries logo]]
Ralph Leroy Nafziger founded Interstate in 1930 in Kansas City as a wholesaler selling bread loaves wrapped in [[gingham]] wrapping to grocery stores.  In 1937 Interstate merged with the [[Chicago]] baker [[Schulze Baking Company]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Interstate-Bakeries-Corporation-Company-History.html  International Directory of Company Histories, Vol. 38. St. James Press, 2001] (via fundingverse.com)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943 it acquired Supreme Baking Company in [[Los Angeles]].  In 1950 it bought O'Rourke Baking Company of [[Buffalo, New York]].

In the 1950s and early 1960s purchases included Ambrosia Cake Company, the Remar Baking Company, the Butter Cream Baking Company, Campbell-Sell Baking Company, the Kingston Cake Bakery, Cobb's Sunlit Bakery, Schall Tasty Baking Company, Sweetheart Bread Company, and Hart's Bakeries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Interstate-Bakeries-Corporation-Company-History.html  International Directory of Company Histories, Vol. 38. St. James Press, 2001] (via fundingverse.com)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interstate Brands===
In the late 1960s it acquired Millbrook Bread, Baker Canning Company, Shawano Farms, Inc. and the Shawano Canning Company.

In 1969 it changed its name to Interstate Brands.  Its signature brands were Butternut and Blue Seal breads, and Dolly Madison cakes. Butternut Breads was a manufacturer of bread products that had been in business since 1902.

===DPF===
In 1975 it was acquired by Data Processing Financial and General Corporation, known as DPF, a computer leasing company, that ran into difficulties with IBM during the period of the [[History of IBM|IBM antitrust battles]]). As a result, DPF was interested in changing business models, and using its cash to take over a low-tech company. The merged company, with headquarters in [[Hartsdale, New York]], took the name, &quot;DPF,&quot; until the divestiture of the remaining technology assets. At that point, it changed the company name back to Interstate. 

During the DPF era, the company invested heavily in its plants and also acquired Silver Loaf Baking Company, Eddy Bakeries, and Mrs. Cubbison's Foods, Inc.  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Interstate-Bakeries-Corporation-Company-History.html  International Directory of Company Histories, Vol. 38. St. James Press, 2001] (via fundingverse.com)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interstate Bakeries===
In 1981 DPF completed the sale of its remaining computer systems and renamed the company back to its original Interstate Bakeries and moved its headquarters back to Kansas City.

In 1986 it acquired Purity Baking Company and Stewart Sandwiches followed in 1987 by Landshire Food Products.

===IBC Holdings===
In 1987 management took the company private and it bought the Merita/Cotton's Bakeries division of the American Bakeries Company.

===Interstate Bakeries===
In 1991 the company changed back to Interstate Bakeries and went public again.

====Continental Baking Merger====
In January 1995, it acquired Continental Baking Company, for $330 million and 16.9 million shares of Interstate stock from [[Ralston Purina]].  It bought San Francisco French Bread Company, John J. Nissen Baking Company, [[Drake's]], and My Bread Company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Interstate-Bakeries-Corporation-Company-History.html  International Directory of Company Histories, Vol. 38. St. James Press, 2001] (via fundingverse.com)&lt;/ref&gt;

Under ex-Merita Baking head Charles Sullivan, Butternut and Wonder Bread operated with different cultures: Butternut was unregimented and each bakery was a self-contained profit center; Wonder Bread was very &quot;procedural and by-the-book.&quot; This caused some problems early on. In both cultures, snack cakes were more profitable due to [[economy of scale]] and [[logistics]].  When extended-shelf-life enzymes were developed for bread, the hope was to convert the system of many small inefficient bakeries into an efficient network of a relatively few giant bakeries like their snackcakes operation. However, the recipe using the new enzymes caused the bread to have a different taste and texture &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mindfully.org/Industry/2004/Wonder-Bread-Interstate23sep04.htm  Wall Street Journal Article, September 24, 2004, via Mindfully.org]&lt;/ref&gt;, and other market forces like a resurrection of the [[Atkins Nutritional Approach|Atkin's diet]] and competitor [[Krispy Kreme]] [[doughnut]]s affected pricing and sales volume.

====Bankruptcy====
On September 22, 2004, Interstate Bakeries filed for [[chapter 11 bankruptcy]]. The company also named a new chief executive. James R. Elsessor, who had taken over as CEO for Charles Sullivan, was replaced by Tony Alvarez. Interstate Bakery's stock, which had been at one time $34/share, fell to $2.05/share as they declared bankruptcy. At the time it was the longest bankruptcy in US history. 
With the leadership of Craig Jung, the company emerged from bankruptcy as a private company on February 3, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/stories/2009/02/02/daily31.html Interstate Bakeries emerges from bankruptcy - Business Courier of Cincinnati - February 4, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;.  The plan included a 50 percent equity stake by [[Ripplewood Holdings]] and lines/loans by [[General Electric Capital]] and [[GE Capital Markets]], Silver Point Finance and Monarch Master Funding.  Interstate's union workers made contract concessions in exchange for equity.  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kansascity.com/382/story/971277.html Interstate Bakeries’ post-bankruptcy funding appears in trouble Kansas City Star - January 8, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since declaring bankruptcy, Interstate has closed nine of its 54 bakeries and more than 300 outlet stores.  It has also reduced its work force from 32,000 to 22,000 people and has pulled out of some markets, such as Los Angeles, where it no longer sells bread.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kansascity.com/382/story/971277.html Interstate Bakeries’ post-bankruptcy funding appears in trouble Kansas City Star - January 8, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hostess Brands, Inc.====
Effective November 2, 2009, the company was renamed Hostess Brands, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS150587+02-Nov-2009+BW20091102&lt;/ref&gt;
